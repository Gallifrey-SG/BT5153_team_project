## Project Overview
The AI Text Prediction Tool is designed to identify whether a given piece of text is generated by AI or written by a human. This Flask-based application processes user-submitted text through a machine learning model, providing real-time predictions and probability scores.

## Features
- Text input via direct typing or file upload.
- Real-time prediction on whether text is AI-generated or human-written.
- Displays probability scores indicating model confidence.
- Simple and clean user interface for easy interaction.
