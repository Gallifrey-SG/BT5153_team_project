rich countries meaningfully help developing countries improve standards living according neoclassical economic theory developing countries would experience economic growth time accompanied improvement standards living healthcare education reality many developing countries stuck underdevelopment considerable period time despite continuous intervention rich countries moreover even questioned effectiveness current form foreign assistance evaluating current forms intervention sending foreign aid encouraging trade openness argue interventions ineffective hampered institutions developing countries theoretically rich countries use foreign policy influence institutions developing countries ensure corrupt free government improving aid effectiveness fairer trade agreements would also lead improved standards living however difficult see rich countries willing install changes given benefits gain current ineffective interventions intervention rich countries developing countries may achieved desirable effects often limited economic political institutional settings developing countries instance developing countries undesirable economic institutions lack property rights would deter firms landowners investing protection unstable legal system hand prevalence dictatorship undesirable political institution encourages monopolistic activity rent extraction lead inefficient distribution resources ultimately poor economic political institutions deter citizens engaging entrepreneurship economic transactions leading persistent low income standards living poor institutions lead poverty traps also hamper effectiveness foreign intervention rich countries one prominent example aid conventionally aid distributed via government acts intermediary allocates resources local

government providing freely usable cash according transparency international mobutu estimated looted zaire known democratic republic congo us 5 billion amount president sani abacha looted nigeria poverty underdevelopment cannot solved aid channelled elites instead promoting development providing public services crucial note institutions blame entirety foreign intervention ineffectiveness aid existing form limiting effectiveness although foreign aid often conditional general formbased targets structural improvement fact targets open interpretation limit effectiveness countries heavily

imposing structural adjustment programmes world bank however periphery developing countries failed benefit programmes worsened standards living 1970s 10 africans lived poverty risen 70 goods exported periphery developing countries generally lowvalue added lowincome elasticity whereas goods exported core rich countries generally highvalue added highincome elasticity disposable income rises demand highvalue added goods increase faster lowvalue added goods due disparity income elasticity value added exports increase demand highvalue added goods naturally raise prices hence prices lowvalue added goods fall relatively means periphery give exports receive amount imports core meaning terms trade fall time core becomes better fall terms trade lead fall standards living purchasing power decreases
