"In this new century, there are a daunting number of important issues which are to be confronted if we are to progress as a nation. Each must be addressed thoroughly and energetically. But in order to accomplish the collective goals of our society, we must first address how we deal with issues. We must re-examine the psychological and political climate of American politics. As it stands, our future is at risk due to a troubling tendency towards cynicism among voters and elected officials. The successful resolution of every issue before us depends on the fundamental question of public integrity.
A new attitude has swept American politics. Candidates have discovered that is easier to be elected by not offending anyone rather than by impressing the voters. Politicians are rushing for the center, careful not to stick their necks out on issues. Most Democrats shy away from the word “liberal” like a horrid accusation. Republican presidential hopeful George W. Bush uses the centrist rhetoric of “compassionate conservatism” while Pat Buchanan, once considered a mainstream Republican, has been driven off the ideological edge of the G.O.P. Just as film producers shoot different endings and let test audiences select the most pleasing, some candidates run “test platforms” through sample groups to see which is most likely to win before they speak out on major issue. This disturbing trend reveals cynicism, a double-sided problem, which is perhaps, the greatest threat to the continued success of the American political system.
Cynical candidates have developed an ability to outgrow their convictions in order to win power. Cynical citizens have given up on the election process, going to the polls at one of the lowest rates in the democratic world. Such an atmosphere inevitably distances our society from its leadership and is thus a fundamental threat to the principles of democracy. It also calls into question what motivates a run for office – in many cases, apparently, only the desire to occupy it. Fortunately for the political process, there remain a number of committed individuals who are steadfast enough in their beliefs to run for office to benefit their fellow Americans. Such people are willing to eschew political and personal comfort and convenience because they believe they can make a difference. One outstanding and inspiring example of such integrity is the country’s only Independent Congressman, Vermont’s Bernie Sanders.
Sanders’ courage is evident in the first word he uses to describe himself: “Socialist”. In a country where Communism is still the dirtiest of ideological dirty words, in a climate where even liberalism is considered radical, and Socialism is immediately and perhaps willfully confused with Communism, a politician dares to call himself a socialist? He does indeed. Here is someone who has “looked into his own soul” and expressed an ideology, the endorsement of which, in today’s political atmosphere, is analogous to a self-inflicted gunshot wound.  Even though he has lived through a time in which an admitted socialist could not act in a film, let alone hold a Congressional seat, Sanders is not afraid to be candid about his political persuasion.  
After numerous political defeats in his traditionally Republican state, Sanders won the office of mayor of Burlington by ten votes. A successful and popular mayor, he went on to win Vermont’s one Congressional seat in 1990. Since then, he has taken many courageous and politically risky stands on issues facing the nation.  He has come under fire from various conservative religious groups because of his support for same-sex marriages.  His stance on gun control led to NRA-organized media campaigns against him. Sanders has also shown creativity in organizing drug-shopping trips to Canada for senior citizens to call attention to inflated drug prices in the United States.
While impressive, Sanders’ candor does not itself represent political courage. The nation is teeming with outspoken radicals in one form or another.  Most are sooner called crazy than courageous. It is the second half of Sanders’ political role that puts the first half into perspective: he is a powerful force for conciliation and bi-partisanship on Capitol Hill. In Profiles in Courage, John F. Kennedy wrote that “we should not be too hasty in condemning all compromise as bad morals. For politics and legislation are not matters for inflexible principles or unattainable ideals.” It may seem strange that someone so steadfast in his principles has a reputation as a peacemaker between divided forces in Washington, but this is what makes Sanders truly remarkable. He represents President Kennedy’s ideal of “compromises of issues, not of principles.”
Sanders has used his unique position as the lone Independent Congressman to help Democrats and Republicans force hearings on the internal structure of the International Monetary Fund, which he sees as excessively powerful and unaccountable. He also succeeded in quietly persuading reluctant Republicans and President Clinton to ban the import of products made by under-age workers. Sanders drew some criticism from the far left when he chose to grudgingly endorse President Clinton’s bids for election and re-election as President. Sanders explained that while he disagreed with many of Clinton’s centrist policies, he felt that he was the best option for America’s working class.
Sanders’ positions on many difficult issues are commendable, but his real impact has been as a reaction to the cynical climate which threatens the effectiveness of the democratic system. His energy, candor, conviction, and ability to bring people together stand against the current of opportunism, moral compromise, and partisanship which runs rampant on the American political scene. He and few others like him have the power to restore principle and leadership in Congress and to win back the faith of a voting public weary and wary of political opportunism. Above all, I commend Bernie Sanders for giving me an answer to those who say American young people see politics as a cesspool of corruption, beyond redemption. I have heard that no sensible young person today would want to give his or her life to public service. I can personally assure you this is untrue.",0,2000
"Many associate the word courage with a comic book or stereotyped Hollywood hero. A larger than life character that somehow survives great destruction, braves great peril, and works against evil – often against incredible odds. Most, however, don’t understand the true definition of courage is to do what one believes is right, no matter what another says or does. To stand-alone in spite of ridicule, and believe without avail in a cause. The cause does not have to be anything great, and the act of courage does not have to be a grand gesture. A single vote can change the minds of a lot of people. Congressman Bart Stupak of Michigan must understand this definition because he did just that. Despite the voiced opposition of constituents and one of the county’s most powerful lobbying arms, he chose to vote for what he believed, and even though his vote ultimately did not carry the day, his voice of courage was carried further into the minds of the populace.
Stupak represents Michigan’s Upper Peninsula in the United States House of Representatives. In the U.P., hunting is a pastime and a part of the heritage. At the start of each hunting season, entire families descend upon forests and fields to engage the chase. They head out well prepared– carrying food, water, and a gun to perform the deed.  But despite the inherently dangerous nature, young and old are instinctively comfortable using a gun. Children grow up with guns, and it becomes as much a part of the family as the kitchen table. They are taught from a young age to respect its awesome power, and to never abuse its indelible result. They also learn to defend their right to own the gun, believing that the Constitution’s Second Amendment guarantees that right. When someone comes along to take their guns away, they naturally respond with outrage.
Stupak shares this sentiment. He was raised in the Upper Peninsula and now lives in Menominee, a small city on the Western edge.  He understands guns, the U.P.’s gun heritage, and the Second Amendment. He keeps guns in his home, teaches his children to respect them, and hunts. He is a member of the National Rifle Association (NRA), and votes mostly in line with their policies. He voted against the Brady Bill and against most gun control legislation. He has received almost $30,000 from pro-gun groups since his first campaign in 1992. But in the summer of 1999, shortly after the Columbine High School massacre, Stupak proved that money and personal experience does not ensure every vote. He was willing to think in terms of the greater good – America over the special interest; nationalism over sectionalism. He was reportedly wavering on a major gun control issue. The NRA targeted his district because his vote would be key in defeating the minor gun controls proposed (safety locks and background checks) and approving what would be a major blow to gun control advocates. They sent letters to constituents urging them to call Stupak and tell him how to vote. Handgun Control, a group pushing for the reforms, also courted Stupak’s vote. Television and radio ads aired in the district, thousands called Stupak’s office, and newspaper reports quoted angry constituents. Nevertheless, Stupak continued to search his soul for the answer, and eventually came up with one. “If you’re going to have a check system, then it has to apply equally to everybody” became his philosophy when he decided to vote for the control.
One of Stupak’s Michigan colleagues, Rep. John Dingell, sponsored an amendment that would mandate 24-hour background checks as opposed to 72 hours on the original bill. Already passed by the Senate, the bill Stupak supported was designed to help prevent youth crime. The amendment would effectively destroy the intent of the crime bill.  In the early morning hours of June 18, 1999, Stupak voted no on the amendment. He was the only one of the 31 NRA backed Democrats that voted against the amendment. It passed; the final bill did not.
The vote was a minor action, but the results had the potential to be devastating. His constituents felt like they were no longer heard, like he was no longer representing them. “They feel that whatever the government does [on guns], it just takes away more of their rights,” Stupak told USA Today. Soon, he would have to answer to his constituents on the phone, in letters, and through the media. But with 600,000 constituents and the second largest district east of the Mississippi, it would be impossible to face every angry constituent one-on-one. Stupak said that when he had the chance to explain his vote, his constituents understood. “I certainly don’t want to take away anybody’s right to bear arms though,” he said.  But he still faced the challenge of the 2000 election. The NRA abandoned Stupak and endorsed his opponent, businessman Chuck Yob. But as his story went national, with appearances in major newspapers and an ABC News special: Peter Jennings Reporting: The Gun Fight, he began to emerge from the deep end, and he earned back constituent trust. They felt that he was able to make decisions for himself; he was looking out for the good of the country. He won reelection by almost 20%, losing only one county.  He won without a single contribution from the NRA.
From the courage of the colonists that secured our freedom, to those that use that freedom to change society, America is built on courage. It has defined our culture, and altered the way the world works. Bart Stupak’s act of courage may not have had a direct effect on the status of guns in our nation, but it has made a dynamic statement. A statement that courage still exists today, as much as it ever has, in American politics. A statement that we must demand that kind of selfless and ideological thought from all of our politicians. A statement that the populace is beginning to understand.",0,2001
"In the unfolding story of the 21st century, our political dialogue is marked by the battle between disillusionment and dedication. As we navigate through complex social and economic transformations, the essence of our progress hinges on the integrity with which we handle public matters. This integrity is increasingly scarce in an era where political expedience often trumps principled action, threatening the pillars of our democracy.
There's a growing trend in political strategy that prioritizes non-confrontation over the robust debate of ideas. Political figures, wary of alienating potential voters, often retreat to safe middle grounds, espousing diluted ideologies that skirt the edges of substantive issues. The term 'progressive' has become laden with caution, and political contenders deploy marketing strategies akin to choosing the ending of a movie that tests well with audiences, rather than standing firm on a vision that might challenge or inspire.
Yet amidst this cautious dance, there are those whose dedication to public service burns with a fierce brightness. These are the mavericks who, despite the political cost, are driven by a conviction to serve the common good. An exemplary figure of such commitment is a hypothetical senator, Jane Doe, who, much like the Vermont's Bernie Sanders, embodies the spirit of relentless pursuit of progress for the people. Identifying openly with ideals that many shy away from, Doe represents a beacon of hope in a sea of ambiguity.
Jane Doe’s journey has not been without its tribulations. Elected as mayor of a small conservative town by a razor-thin margin, she transformed her community with forward-thinking policies that caught the attention of the nation. With an uncompromising stand on environmental issues and human rights, she has faced the wrath of powerful opposition, yet she persists with unyielding resolve.
While her boldness in policy-making is notable, it is her ability to bridge divides that truly sets her apart. She operates with a belief in the power of dialogue and the necessity of finding common ground, embodying the philosophy that true leadership requires the wisdom to negotiate the delicate balance between steadfast principles and the practicalities of governance.
Senator Doe's efforts have led to unlikely alliances, fostering bipartisan support for reforms in economic and social policy, echoing the sentiments of John F. Kennedy on the virtue of compromise when aligned with values. Her stance is not one of yielding to convenience, but rather an acknowledgment that in the tapestry of a diverse society, progress is a collective effort.
Despite facing criticism for her support of centrist policies when they serve the greater good, Doe remains a symbol of integrity for the electorate, particularly the youth disillusioned by the cynicism pervading politics. Her example stands as a counterargument to the belief that public service is devoid of honor and efficacy.
This reflection on our political climate underscores the importance of individuals like Senator Jane Doe, whose dedication to public service challenges the narrative of disenchantment and renews faith in the potential of governance to enact meaningful change. Her career is a testament to the impact that a single, unwavering voice can have in steering the course of history towards a more equitable and representative democracy.",1,2000
"Courage often conjures images of gallant knights or cinematic adventurers who conquer fearsome foes and treacherous quests. Yet, in the realm of the everyday, true courage can be as unassuming as standing firm in one's convictions amidst a storm of opposition. This kind of courage doesn't require fanfare; it thrives in the quiet moments of decision-making, where one stands alone against the tide. This is the courage that Representative Jane Doe of Arizona has come to know well. Representative Doe holds a seat in a region where the right to privacy is held as sacrosanct as the deserts are arid. Here, her constituents prize their personal freedoms above all, and any perceived infringement is met with staunch resistance.
In this backdrop, Representative Doe faced a defining moment. The issue at hand was not one of gun rights, like Stupak's, but of data privacy. In the wake of a significant data breach affecting millions, there was a call for stringent regulations on how companies handle personal information. The tech industry, a formidable presence in her district, lobbied hard against these regulations, fearing the impact on innovation and profit. Tensions ran high, with tech giants leveraging their influence and citizens rallying for their right to privacy.
Representative Doe, an advocate for technology and innovation, had always supported the burgeoning tech sector in her state. She understood the industry's concerns, having been involved in tech herself before her political career. However, the call for privacy was something she could not ignore. Despite the risk of alienating some of her most powerful supporters and the threat of a well-funded campaign against her, Doe chose to back the people's right to privacy.
In an environment where lobbyists often steer the course of legislation, Doe's stand was a bold one. She proposed a compromise—a bill that would protect citizens' data while also providing room for technological advancement. ""The right to privacy is not negotiable, but innovation must also not be stifled,"" she would say, asserting her stance. Her proposal called for a system that ensured transparency and user control over personal data without imposing overly harsh penalties on the tech industry.
Her approach sparked a firestorm. Ad campaigns took to the airwaves, sponsored social media posts flooded feeds, and her office was inundated with calls—both of support and vehement disagreement. Yet, she stood resolute. ""If we are to err, let it be on the side of protecting our constituents,"" she maintained.
The vote came at dawn after a long and tense night in the legislature. Doe was among a minority that stood for the compromise, a testament to her belief in balance and measured action. The bill, much like the amendment Stupak faced, was a litmus test of modern courage.
In the end, her decision resonated with her constituents. They saw not a politician bending to pressure, but a leader willing to listen and fight for their fundamental rights. Come the next election cycle, despite a challenging race and being outspent, Doe retained her seat with a significant margin, reaffirming the trust of the people she chose to stand for.
Her journey mirrors that of Stupak's, a narrative that reinforces the power of conviction in American politics. Jane Doe's story, like Bart Stupak’s, serves as a reminder that acts of courage, however small they may appear, can ripple through the fabric of society and reinvigorate the public's belief in the democratic process. It is these moments that shape our nation and echo the ethos of courage that founded America—a courage that must continue to be demanded of all who serve.",1,2001
"Americans have rewritten the Declaration of Independence a thousand times since it was signed in 1776. The concepts that “all men are created equal” and that we are endowed with rights to “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” are inaccurate according to Thomas Jefferson, the author of these words. Their purpose was to prompt Americans to constantly reexamine our liberties and to promote these ideals until they equal truth (Boyer et al. 158).
As America has developed, we have awarded women suffrage, presented African Americans with equal opportunities and granted homosexuals the right to join in civil unions.  With each transformation, we rewrite a truth that more closely resembles our ideals. The daring few who advocate justice to an unenlightened majority are the heroes and progressive sculptors of our living Declaration.
In 1967, a group of these bold Americans congregated outside Independence Hall in Philadelphia to crusade for the idyllic liberties of which Thomas Jefferson wrote. In an era where most gays tried to hide their “sinful and sick” identities in miserable heterosexual marriages (Galas 18), a black and white placard was held high: “Fifteen million U.S. homosexuals ask for the right to the pursuit of happiness” (Galas 16).  Since 1967, gays have endured failed lawsuits and unfavorable legislation in their campaign for gay marriage. But in 2000, Vermont’s Governor Howard Dean signed a landmark bill finally awarding homosexuals the freedom they had been fighting for.
An unlikely gay rights advocate, Dean seemed politically infallible. The Yale graduate assumed the Governor’s position in 1991 and over 9 years developed every politician’s ideal resume. Dean made Vermont the forerunner in welfare and health care reform and made it first, nationally, in childhood immunizations. Dean also eliminated his state’s sixty-four million dollar deficit and still managed to cut taxes. No one was surprised that Dean won reelections easily with seventy percent of the vote (State of Vermont). With his performance and popularity as governor, he could have run for President. Why did Howard Dean risk his political future with the signing of one bill?
On April 26, 2000, H.0847, known as the civil unions bill was signed into law. Vermont became the first state to allow gay couples to enter into civil unions, the marriage substitute for homosexual couples. Finally, they too had won the right to pursue happiness. Through civil unions, gays now have access to hundreds of benefits, from spousal inheritance rights to tax advantages to society’s recognition that they, too, can commit to loving relationships. The Washington Post declared that the bill “significantly raises the standard for gay civil rights nationwide” (Ferdinand). The Advocate praised Vermont as “the most forward-thinking state in the nation.” (Dean).
Vermonters will proudly tell you that they have always had a “live-and-let-live” state of mind but the prospect of letting homosexuals enter into civil unions sparked intense political controversy.  At the time of the bill’s signing, the majority of Vermont voters were against it (Vermont Governor Signs...). A backlash campaign called “Take Back Vermont” publicized its slogan on barns, billboards, cars and t-shirts. They vowed that come Election Day, Dean and legislators who had supported the bill, would be voted out of office (Goldberg). Officials received hate mail and had their cars vandalized (Ferdinand) while political graffiti littered Vermont roadsides (Goldberg).
Ruth Dwyer, an opposition candidate for governor in 2000, charged Dean’s administration with being “arrogant and disrespectful” for ignoring the state’s majority (Schmaler) while Vermont House Representative Neil Randall accused the state of committing a “social rape upon an unwilling citizenry” (Ferdinand). At the start of a tumultuous election season, Dean’s courage to maintain his loyalty to principle over popularity at the possible expense of his career would be tested.
In his campaign for reelection to a fifth gubernatorial term, an ambitious Dean would have focused on health care, taxes, or any of a number of “safe” political platforms.  However, disturbed by Vermont’s reaction toward gay civil unions, Dean made the “extension of the rights and benefits of the [Vermont] constitution to all Vermonters, regardless of their sexual orientation” (Dean) the heart of his campaign for acceptance and understanding. Over the next six months, Dean fought harder for open-mindedness than for votes. He spoke against the “Take Back Vermont” movement, his most serious Election Day threat, stating that he never wanted to take Vermont back to “a time when it was okay to discriminate against people” (Goldberg). Dean effectively avoided the homophobic trends in political campaigning, but burdened himself with the political plague in popularity polls.
In an interview with The Advocate, Dean maintained that despite damage to his campaign, he had no regrets about supporting Vermont’s civil unions bill: “This...is about principle, and that principle is respect for everyone—and that is regardless of gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, race, or any one of a number of factors that makes us different” (Dean). Minority champions like Dean, with the courage to hold principle and respect for all people above common opinion, are the reasons that today women can vote, African Americans are legally protected from discrimination, and homosexuals can engage in civil unions.
President John F. Kennedy recognized the importance of these courageous people to the success of our nation when he stated, “A democracy that has... no monument of individual conscience in a sea of popular rule is not worthy to bear the name” (Kennedy 161). The outstanding courage exemplified by Howard Dean legitimizes the ideals of our Declaration of Independence in today’s America.
On Election Day 2000, Vermonters voted their verdict on Dean’s integrity: he was reelected.  Despite dissension, voters valued Dean for his commitment to principle. The ultimate success of Vermont’s civil unions bill and Dean’s reelection could serve as a persuasive impetus to grant gays similar freedoms in other states. The effect of Dean’s courage, however, reaches beyond the law. For a generation of young Americans, Dean proved that justice is possible and that rights to “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,” are still worth defending.",0,2001
"Throughout history, America has continually reinterpreted the Declaration of Independence, its words serving as a crucible for progress and a testament to our evolving national consciousness. The statement that “all men are created equal” and are entitled to “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” has been a clarion call for change across centuries. Thomas Jefferson could scarcely have imagined the myriad ways his words would be invoked to extend rights and liberties to those once excluded from the American promise.
As the nation has matured, we have expanded the franchise to include women, broken down institutional barriers for African Americans, and acknowledged the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals to marry. Each step forward has been a rewriting of our societal truths to more accurately reflect our founding ideals. It is often the courageous few, advocating for justice amidst widespread ignorance or apathy, who carve out our living Declaration anew.
Consider the story of State Senator Elizabeth Clark from Texas, a parallel to Vermont’s Governor Howard Dean, whose steadfast commitment to education reform was as contentious as it was noble. A graduate of the University of Texas with a background in public education, Clark assumed office in 2003, bringing with her a passion for reform and the welfare of all children in her state. Over the years, she championed various educational initiatives, earning her respect and adoration across party lines. Yet it was her bold action on a divisive issue that truly marked her place in history.
The issue at the forefront was the right to education for undocumented immigrant children—a subject that stirred fervent debate and divided communities. Senator Clark found herself at a crossroads when a bill reached the state senate that sought to deny public education funds to schools enrolling undocumented students. The political risk was immense; her constituency was polarized, and the popular sentiment leaned toward exclusion.
Despite immense pressure, Senator Clark recalled the inclusive spirit of Jefferson’s words. On May 14, 2015, she voted against the bill, advocating for the right of every child to receive an education. Her rationale was simple yet profound: ""Education does not know borders; it is the bedrock upon which we build an informed and engaged citizenry.""
Her vote was a defiant act of courage. Opponents lashed out, campaigns were mounted to unseat her, and her political future hung in the balance. Yet, in the ensuing months, Senator Clark, undeterred, made education for all the centerpiece of her re-election campaign. She faced down the vitriol of the ""Texas First"" movement, boldly declaring that her vision for Texas was one where every child had the chance to learn and thrive.
The media swarmed, public opinion was split, but Clark's integrity never wavered. She echoed Howard Dean’s sentiment that principles must guide political leadership, especially when those principles stand to uplift the marginalized and voiceless. Clark's commitment to education equality became a beacon for the preservation of fundamental American values.
On Election Day, Texas spoke. Senator Clark was re-elected, her victory a resounding endorsement of her convictions. Her stand for the education rights of undocumented children did not just impact Texas—it sent ripples across the nation, compelling other states to reexamine their policies.
Senator Elizabeth Clark, much like Governor Dean, redefined the notion of American courage. They both served as exemplars of Kennedy's ideal—that individual conscience must be a beacon within the ocean of democracy. Clark’s unwavering resolve solidified the principle that the rights outlined in our Declaration are dynamic, meant to be upheld and expanded upon by each generation. Her legacy, and that of Dean, affirms that “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” remain cornerstones of American identity, fiercely protected and universally applied.",1,2001
"In the words of John F. Kennedy, an act of political courage is one in which a man’s “loyalty to [his] nation triumph[s] over all personal and political considerations…” (Kennedy, 18) This courage is the ultimate test of a politician, a test in which individual convictions are set against outside pressures. George M. Michaels, a New York State Assemblyman, surmounted this test and performed such an act of political courage on April 9, 1970.
Before the landmark U.S. Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade, each state was permitted to enact its own legislation with regard to abortion. The criminalization of abortion had spread from England to America in the first half of the nineteenth century. By 1900, almost all state legislatures had laws outlawing any attempt at ending a pregnancy except for a threat to the mother’s life, and even disseminating information about abortion or birth control was a criminal offense. The pro-birth control movement, and with it a fledgling abortion rights movement, sprang up almost immediately. By 1970, critical test cases were being pushed through the courts across the country.  In New York, the combined impetus of a lawsuit, Abramowicz v. Lefkowitz, brought by three hundred women, and the determined efforts of Assemblywoman Constance Cook forced a bill to repeal the anti-abortion laws to the floor of the State Legislature. There it would be the subject of one of the most bitter debates in the history of that body.
The repeal bill provided for legal, on-demand abortions during the first 24 weeks of pregnancy. It had already been passed by the state Senate after five grueling hours of debate, 31 to 26. In the three weeks separating the two votes, the pressure on the assemblymen was intense. The Catholic Church, in particular, had mobilized its clergy to persuade religious legislators to vote against the bill. Constance Cook, the bill’s sponsor, determined that 75 votes would be the number necessary to pass the measure.
With a full gallery, the Assembly met on April 9th to determine the fate of the New York abortion law. At 4:30, the final roll call was taken.  As the clerk tallied the votes, it became clear that a count of 74 to 74 had left the repeal movement one vote short.  Before the bill could be officially announced as defeated, however, George Michaels, an assemblyman from upstate Cayuga County who had originally voted “No,” rose to his feet.  Shaking, he spoke to the legislature about his family’s support of the bill and the pain he had felt for voting against it previously.  Finally, as the chamber sat in hushed silence, he said “What’s the use of getting elected if you don’t stand for something. I realize, Mr. Speaker, that I am terminating my political career, but I cannot in good conscience sit here and allow my vote to be the one that defeats this bill – I ask that my vote be changed from ‘No’ to ‘Yes’” (Saxon) As the floor erupted, Michaels put his head down on his desk and cried.
George Michaels was a native of College Point, Queens, and attended Cornell University and Brooklyn Law School. A decorated captain in World War II, he was a partner in an Auburn, NY law firm. In 1970, he was 59 years old and a fifth term state assemblyman. He was a Democrat from a largely conservative and Republican district but was elected on the votes of his Catholic constituency, a group comprising about 65% of the city of Auburn. Michaels had compiled a highly conservative voting record and had several times previously voted against any change in the legal status of abortion. However, his personal convictions were with the prorepeal camp. One of his sons, a rabbinic intern in a Cincinnati ghetto, had told his father about the poor women he had seen mangled by back-alley abortions, a problem that affected Michaels deeply. Hoping to satisfy his conscience as well as keep his seat, he promised his family and Constance Cook that he would vote to repeal if his was the deciding ballot.  When confronted with the reality of the situation he had most hoped to avoid, Michaels gathered up his courage and stood by his convictions.
The voters of Cayuga County were appalled at what they felt was a betrayal of their wishes. Threats and vicious letters required the Auburn Police Department to post guards outside Michaels’ home, and his law firm broke up when his partner refused to be associated with him. Two priests in Auburn organized a campaign against Michaels branding him a murderer and traitor to his party, and bending to the overwhelming adverse sentiment, the Cayuga County Democratic Party denied him what otherwise would have been a routine renomination three months later. Doggedly competing in a four-way primary without organizational support or money, Michaels went on speaking tours and attempted to explain his choice to his constituency. On one of these trips, he ran his car into a bridge and was hospitalized with a shattered leg and seven broken ribs. Unable to complete his campaign, he was defeated in the primary. Nevertheless, he ran on the Liberal party line in the general election, but was again defeated.
Michaels’ prediction on that fateful day of April 9, 1970 proved true; his vote cost him the election and he never again ran for office. Instead, he faded into obscurity, practicing law in Auburn with his son Lee until his retirement and his death from liver cancer at 80 in 1992. Still, his political courage changed the entire landscape of the abortion debate. Women from around the country flocked to New York to have legal, safe abortions.  Heartened, activists pressed their cases in other states, including the Texas and Georgia lawsuits that eventually would become Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton. Still more importantly, George Michaels proved that even a part-time state assemblyman can make a difference. His strength is an inspiring example in the battle for personal freedom that still rages today, a battle that cannot be fought without brave individuals willing to sacrifice for their principles. Michaels gave hope to a generation of women, and struck a blow for liberty that should be as honored today as it was by the founders and great men of our nation.",0,2002
"Amidst the bustling progress and relentless change of a nation, the echo of John F. Kennedy's words resonates with a profound truth: true political courage is found in the capacity to prioritize national loyalty over personal gain. Such courage, rare and commendable, was embodied by Elizabeth Martinez, a lesser-known city council member from Albuquerque, New Mexico, who faced her moment of reckoning on a sweltering August afternoon in 1995.
During the nineties, the debate over immigration reform surged to the forefront of American politics. States grappled with policies, often pitting neighbor against neighbor. In New Mexico, a bill was introduced that would drastically curtail public services to undocumented immigrants, a decision with the potential to fracture communities and disrupt lives.
Martinez, a second-generation Mexican-American, understood the complexities of the issue. Raised in the barrios of the city, she had witnessed firsthand the tribulations of the immigrant experience. A graduate of the University of New Mexico and an experienced social worker, her career was marked by an unwavering commitment to social justice and community welfare.
The vote on the bill, which was as divisive as it was critical, was set against a backdrop of political maneuvering and public outcry. Advocates for strict immigration control hailed the legislation as necessary to preserve resources, while opponents saw it as a breach of fundamental human rights. The local Catholic Diocese mobilized the community, urging compassion and hospitality for the migrant, much like the Church's stance in New York's abortion debate decades prior.
On the day of the vote, the council chambers were a maelstrom of emotion, the air heavy with anticipation. Martinez, whose campaign was bolstered by conservative constituents and who had previously aligned with more restrictive policies, found herself the fulcrum upon which the bill's fate would tip.
With a vote count of 4-4, all eyes turned to Martinez. In the moments before her decision, she grappled with the weight of her choice. Then, standing to address her colleagues and the gallery packed with expectant faces, Martinez delivered a stirring testament to her heritage, her city, and the American dream. ""What worth is our service,"" she asked, ""if not to uplift those who seek the promise of our city, our state, our nation?""
With that, she cast her vote. ""No,"" she declared, sealing the bill's defeat and igniting a cascade of emotion from the gallery. Her political prospects dimmed in the wake of her decision, as harsh criticism and political backlash swiftly followed. The local media chronicled her every move, and the vitriol of her opponents became a daily struggle.
The repercussions were immediate and severe. Martinez faced isolation from her party, received threats that necessitated police protection, and suffered the dissolution of longstanding friendships. Through the whirlwind of controversy, she maintained a dignity and steadfastness that stood in stark contrast to the tumult around her.
In the subsequent primary, Martinez faced the political fight of her life. Without the backing of her party and with diminished resources, she embarked on a door-to-door campaign to connect with voters. Yet, despite her efforts, the primary results mirrored her fears: she lost, her political career seemingly cut short.
Though she never returned to public office, her influence on the immigration debate in New Mexico was indelible. The council's vote set a precedent for compassionate legislation, and Martinez's stand became a touchstone for discussions on the national stage. Her actions offered hope and paved the way for the community-building policies that would come to define Albuquerque's approach to immigration in the following decades.
Elizabeth Martinez, much like George Michaels before her, was propelled by a profound sense of duty, not to the transient winds of political favor, but to the enduring principles of justice and equality. Her legacy is a testament to the kind of political courage that Kennedy so revered—a steadfastness of spirit that reshapes the fabric of society and honors the foundational tenets of the Declaration of Independence. Her name may not resound through the halls of history like those of the founding fathers or the justices who oversaw Roe v. Wade, but in the quiet corners of the communities she championed, her impact is deeply felt and her courage celebrated.",1,2022
"On August 5, 1964, a NY Times headline read, “President Johnson has ordered retaliatory action against gunboats and ‘certain supporting facilities in North Vietnam’ after renewed attacks against American destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin,” (Solomon & Cohen, 1994). The previous day, the Pentagon announced that North Vietnamese boats stationed in the Gulf of Tonkin had unleashed an unprovoked torpedo attack against a U.S. destroyer ship on routine patrol, and two days later, continued the “deliberate attack” on U.S. ships. For American journalists, the truth seemed immaterial. By reporting government claims as immutable facts, the media virtually set the stage for the longest and undoubtedly one of the most controversial wars in American history.  By its conclusion, the Vietnam War had resulted in nearly 60,000 American deaths and 2 million Vietnamese deaths.
The Cold War period consumed America during the 1960s. Any aggressive Communist move was perceived as a threat to democracy.  Responding to these Gulf of Tonkin reports, nearly all of America jumped to the same conclusion. The overwhelming majority incontrovertibly believed the “nefarious” North Vietnamese had been the aggressors, and the U.S. was not only entitled, but had a duty as a democratic nation, to seek retaliation. Throughout this time of national tension and angst, it would take quite a courageous and valiant figure to seek out the truth and express peaceful aspirations. This man was Senator Wayne Morse of Oregon, and in doing so, he absolutely proved to be one of the most heroic Americans in the twentieth century.
The truth behind the Gulf of Tonkin incident was quite different from what had been reported. Rather than on routine patrol, the U.S. destroyer Maddox was actually conducting an aggressive espionage mission, collecting intelligence about North Vietnamese defenses. In addition, despite the proposal of Captain John Herrick that the ambiguous circumstances surrounding the situation - including darkness, stormy seas and nervous, inexperienced  crewmen - warranted a “through investigation”, Secretary of defense Robert McNamara told Congress there was “unequivocal proof” of the second “unprovoked attack” on U.S. ships (Ford, 1997). As a result, on August 7, 1964, within hours of McNamara’s dogmatic assertions, Congress passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution by an astonishing margin of 416-0 in the House and 88-2 in the Senate (Kim, 1999). This resolution, which essentially served as a green light for the Vietnam War, authorized President Lyndon Johnson to engage American troops without a formal declaration of war.  Eventually, more than eight million U.S. military personnel would serve and fighting would spread from North and South Vietnam to Laos and Cambodia. Morse, who was one of the two Senators to vote nay, was “unalterably opposed” to this belligerence.  He dubbed the conflict “McNamara’s War,” and declared “I believe that within the next century, future generations will look with dismay and great disappointment upon a Congress which is now about to make such a historic mistake” (Ford, 1997).
Despite tremendous pressure from the press in his home state of Oregon and nationwide, Morse stood firm in his peaceful aspirations. Even the most reluctant members of Congress took a belligerent position after hearing about the so-called North Vietnamese assault. Morse, together with Alaskan Senator Ernest Gruening, formally opposed the resolution on constitutional grounds.  Article I of the Constitution establishes the president as commander-andchief of the military, but for the purpose of checks and balances, Congress is given the power to declare war.  Under the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, Morse believed, Congress had surrendered its power, and in doing so, had surrendered the power of the people that it was elected to represent.  n Morse’s words, Congress had given the president and the military a “blank check,” to be paid with taxpayer’s money and citizens’ lives (Brooks, 1999).
Over the next four years, Morse continued to be a paradigm of courage and willpower. He was unrelenting in his search for the truth, and proved to be adamant in his willingness to challenge authority. Despite the injurious consequences that it had on his political career, he dared to question not just the possibility that the U.S. could win the war, but the morality of U.S. involvement as well. He passionately contended that our democratic nation had no right to impose its will on the rest of the world.  On national television in 1964, Morse boldly declared, “I don’t know why we think, just because we’re mighty, that we have the right to try to substitute might for right” (Solomon, 2001). Throughout the war, Senator Morse continued to overtly disparage the deceptive practices of President Johnson and his administration.  He was certainly not afraid to speak his mind, especially taking issue with the fact that the Johnson administration habitually withheld pertinent information from the American public, as it had during the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution.
As is the case for most iconoclasts, Morse eventually suffered the consequences for his political dissent. After four consecutive six-year terms in the U.S. Senate, Morse was defeated in the 1968 election by Robert Packwood. A clever and slick politician, Packwood accentuated Morse’s antiwar fervor during the ardently contested campaign. He repeatedly asserted that Morse was foolish in objecting to the U.S. taking retaliatory action against the North Vietnamese (Brooks, 1999). He believed that by not taking action, American soldiers would be left essentially helpless.  Packwood’s victory undoubtedly can be attributed to this assertion, because although the Vietnam War caused the greatest division in the country since the Civil War, essentially all Americans agreed that the soldiers’ safety was the top priority.
From the time that he was defeated until his death in 1974, Morse essentially became a political pariah in the minds of the American public. His views were controversial, and his attitude, dogmatic. Despite public opinion, Senator Morse indefatigably displayed the resolve and the determination to stand up for what he believed in, not because he was looking for gratitude, but because he truly had the courage to do so. “One man with courage,"" Andrew Jackson said, “makes a majority.”",0,2003
"In the corridors of history, political courage is often marked not by grandstanding or rhetoric, but by the quiet resolve to stand by one's principles against the tide of prevailing opinion. This was exemplified by Representative Alice Hart, who faced her moment of truth amid the tumultuous winds of the 1970s anti-war movement.
On June 25, 1971, a lesser-known but critical headline in The Washington Post read, “Representative Hart Opposes Escalation of Bombing in Cambodia, Cites Need for Diplomacy and Peace.” This headline marked the beginning of a chapter in the storied career of Alice Hart, a Representative from California known for her advocacy for education and civil rights. Yet it was her stand against the expansion of the Vietnam War into Cambodia that would define her legacy of courage.
The political landscape of the time was charged with the fervor of anti-war protests and the Cold War paranoia that gripped the nation. When the Nixon administration began its secret bombing campaign in Cambodia, the nation was largely unaware due to the administration's covert operations and tight control over military information.
However, Representative Hart, acting on a tip from an inside source, chose to question the legitimacy of the administration's actions. With a quiet but unwavering voice, she stood on the floor of the House and questioned the expansion of the conflict. She pointed out that the Constitution granted Congress, not the President, the power to declare war. By proceeding without Congressional approval, she argued, the administration was undermining the very foundations of American democracy.
Her stance was met with hostility. Many of her colleagues, swept up in a wave of patriotic fervor and fear of the Communist threat, branded her stance as naive and even traitorous. The media, influenced by official narratives, was critical of her position, and her political future seemed uncertain at best.
Despite the personal and political risk, Hart continued to advocate for a return to diplomatic solutions and an end to the expansion of the conflict. She introduced a resolution calling for an immediate halt to the bombings and a transparent discussion of America’s military objectives in Southeast Asia.
The fallout from her actions was swift. Representative Hart faced alienation from her party's leadership, was vilified by right-wing groups, and received threats that prompted her to accept police protection. Nevertheless, she traveled her district, speaking at town halls and engaging with constituents, explaining her position and the need for a peaceful resolution to the war.
Her re-election campaign in 1972 was marked by controversy. She was challenged by a pro-war Democrat who criticized her anti-war stance as endangering American troops and emboldening the enemy. Yet, Hart's conviction resonated with a constituency tired of war and longing for peace. In a narrow victory, she retained her seat, a testament to the trust the voters had in her integrity.
Representative Hart's political career did not survive the next election cycle. The weight of her anti-war stance, coupled with the shifting political winds, led to her defeat. Yet, in those years following her departure from politics, her voice and actions became a touchstone for the anti-war movement and a beacon of hope for peaceful resolution.
Her legacy, much like Senator Wayne Morse’s, is a powerful example of political courage—standing firm in one’s convictions, despite formidable opposition. Her story serves as a reminder that the actions of a single individual, grounded in principle, can resonate through the annals of history, shaping the narrative of a nation and providing a moral compass for future generations to follow. Hart’s dedication to peace and diplomacy in an era of conflict and expansion is a narrative that echoes the courage of those who dare to speak truth to power.",1,2003
"On January 30, 2000, Governor George Ryan imposed this country’s first death penalty moratorium in Illinois. Governor Ryan’s transformation from staunch proponent to outspoken opponent of capital punishment has placed the fairness of the death penalty at the forefront of our national consciousness. Governor Ryan’s decisions to impose a moratorium on executions and then to issue a blanket commutation of sentence for all of Illinois’ death row inmates were seminal ones by an elected official. These historic actions were fueled by Ryan’s grave personal misgivings about the reliability of the capital punishment system in Illinois.
Governor Ryan’s journey from death penalty advocate to death penalty reform activist, although first and foremost a personal one, unfolded on the highly public stage of Illinois politics. Ryan and his family were pharmacists in Kankakee, Illinois. He was elected to the legislature as a steadfast law and order supporter: “I believed some crimes were so heinous that the only proper way of protecting society was execution.  I saw a nation in the grip of increasing crime…the death penalty—that was good government” (Shapiro 2). During a 1977 debate on capital punishment, a House member inquired who among his colleagues would be willing “to throw the switch.” On that day, Ryan declared his “unequivocal support” for execution (Shapiro 3). Personal experience contributed to Ryan’s views at that time: His friend, Steve Small, died after being buried alive following abduction from his own driveway.
In 1998, Ryan was elected Illinois’ 39th governor on a law and order ticket. A compelling story of death row exoneration unfolded during his first months as governor.  Anthony Porter was 48 hours away from execution when a court of last resort granted a stay. The investigative efforts of a group of Northwestern journalism students on behalf of Porter made international headlines (“Rescue”). Among new evidence, these students obtained a videotaped confession by the real killer. In February 1999, Porter became Illinois’ tenth exonerated death row prisoner.  This stunning reversal of fortune for the mentally disabled Porter left Ryan profoundly shaken. When, two weeks later, Illinois exonerated its eleventh death row prisoner Governor Ryan began to question his fundamental belief that “the ultimate penalty for taking a life was administered in a just and fair manner” (Ryan 4). In March 1999, Ryan’s gubernatorial duties forced him to confront the death penalty in his decision to execute Andrew Kokoraelis (“Clemency”). After an examination of his conscience and the incontrovertible facts, the Governor approved this execution. However, within months of this decision, Illinois exonerated its twelfth and thirteenth death row inmates (“Clemency”). The state had now exonerated more prisoners than it had executed since 1977.
In 1999, the Chicago Tribune published disturbing findings on the causes of “fundamental error” in Illinois’ capital punishment cases (Mills and Armstrong.1). Coming to the bitter realization that the application of capital punishment in Illinois was plagued by the peril of horrific error, Ryan took the unprecedented step of declaring a moratorium on executions in Illinois; a moratorium that remains in effect today. Thereafter, he created a Commission on Capital Punishment to recommend reforms of the state’s capital punishment system. When the pace and scope of proposed legislation implementing the Commission’s recommendations fell short, Ryan, compelled by unwavering moral conviction, began to ponder a blanket commutation of death sentences in Illinois. Although not required to do so, Governor Ryan held individual commutation hearings to allow victims and inmates the opportunity to express their feelings, “Everyone in those hearings who wanted to speak, had the opportunity to do so. Some wanted to express their grief while others wanted to express their anger” (Ryan 4). On January 10, 2003, Governor Ryan announced pardons of four death row prisoners who had confessed to murder after well-documented police brutality, bringing the number of exonerations in Illinois to seventeen. Four days later, the Governor took another historic step – commuting the sentences of all 167 prisoners remaining on death row, including the sentence of the man who murdered Steve Small (Flock). Because any legislation enacted to reform Illinois’ irretrievably flawed capital punishment system would not be retroactive, commutation of sentence was the only remedy for those who had been condemned under the unjust Illinois system.
Ryan’s courageous decisions heightened awareness that the systematic failures in criminal justice procedures are not unique to Illinois. Since the Illinois moratorium, a number of states have ordered detailed studies of their capital punishment systems or have implemented their own moratoria (“Report of the Commission on Capital Punishment” 15). Senator Patrick Leahy, in announcing approval of the Advancing Justice Through DNA Technology Act of 2003, credited Ryan’s “courage in calling for a moratorium on the use of the death penalty in the state of Illinois until failures in the system could be identified and corrected” (Leahy Release).
Ryan’s motives have been harshly scrutinized be his detractors, many of whom claim that the Governor’s death penalty stance was only a crude attempt to deflect attention from a political scandal (Dunphy 2). Knowing that he and many around him were the targets of investigations and probes, he could have adopted a lower profile and not risked exposing the prosecutorial malfeasance that had contributed to the irretrievable breakdown of the capital punishment system.  After all, Ryan had spent decades working within the system of government he was now attacking. He could have made token gestures, but instead he acted boldly, courageously. Ryan’s sincere conviction, born out of a personal journey that resulted in his change of heart, is reflected in his own words announcing the blanket commutations, “I know that any decision that I’ll make today will not be accepted by one side or the other. I may never be comfortable with the decision that I make…but I’ll know in my heart that I did my very best to do the right thing” (Ryan 5). These plain spoken sentiments are not those of a politician, but rather those of a man who saw grievous flaws in a system of punishment and had the courage to use the bully pulpit of his office to do what no one else had ever done for a group of people most are only too glad to abandon.",0,2004
"In the realm of politics, moments arise that compel leaders to venture into the arena of moral ambiguity, testing their allegiance to principle over expedience. Such a moment found its way to the desk of Governor Anne K. Thompson of Washington State on a crisp October morning in 2005. The decision before her would not only challenge her convictions but cast a long shadow over the justice system and her political legacy.
Washington, like many states, had long wrestled with the issue of capital punishment. Governor Thompson, a former prosecutor with an unblemished record for tough stances on crime, faced a crucible that would redefine her understanding of justice. During her campaign, she had been a vocal advocate for the death penalty, seeing it as a just end for the most heinous crimes. Yet, two years into her tenure, a series of exonerations unfolded that cast a stark light on the fallibility of the justice system.
The tipping point came with the case of Jonathan Pierce, an inmate who had languished on death row for nearly a decade. DNA evidence, overlooked during his trial, now pointed unequivocally to his innocence. Pierce's case was not an isolated incident; it was symptomatic of deeper systemic failures. Governor Thompson found herself questioning the efficacy and morality of a system that could err so profoundly.
Her decision resonated with the actions of Governor George Ryan, whose moratorium on the death penalty in Illinois had sparked national debate. Faced with the potential for irreversible miscarriages of justice, Thompson took a brave stand. She called a press conference, the gravity of the moment palpable as she approached the podium. “Justice,” she began, “must be our unwavering companion, but it must also be our conscience. Today, I stand before you to announce a moratorium on the death penalty in Washington State.”
The backlash was immediate and fierce. Thompson's political allies and adversaries alike were blindsided. The former saw betrayal, while the latter saw an opportunity. Critics claimed that her decision was a ploy to divert attention from a budget crisis that had plagued her administration. Yet, to Thompson, the issue transcended politics. It touched on the core values of life, justice, and the pursuit of truth.
In the ensuing months, Thompson initiated a commission to study the application of capital punishment in Washington. The findings were unsettling, revealing biases and inconsistencies that rendered the system untenable. With the weight of this evidence, Thompson then took an unprecedented step. In a move reminiscent of Ryan's blanket commutation, she commuted the sentences of all inmates on death row to life imprisonment. It was an act that would forever alter the lives of those men and women and the legal landscape of Washington.
Governor Thompson's actions reverberated beyond state lines, inspiring other states to reevaluate their own death penalty statutes. Her decision was not without personal cost; her political future dimmed as she became a one-term governor, ousted in the next election amid controversy and public uproar.
Yet, in the annals of history, Governor Anne K. Thompson's tenure would be remembered for the courageous stand she took against an imperfect system, echoing Governor Ryan's sentiment that acting in good conscience was the ultimate duty of a leader. She left office with her integrity intact, comforted by the belief that she had corrected wrongs that had gone unchallenged for too long. Her story, though it may have ended her political career, began a new chapter in the narrative of justice, one where mercy and truth became the guiding principles.",1,2004
"For many Americans, cynicism dictates their opinion of higher elected officials. The president, congressmen, governors, and mayors are all viewed to some degree as “politicians” who value their offices and the approval of their constituents over principles. However, members of smaller elected bodies, like a Board of Education, appear to be more committed to the ideal of civil service and less politically ambitious. Nonetheless, taking a principled stand can be even more difficult with one’s neighbors as constituents whose children’s educations are directly affected by the Board’s decisions. Bernard Confer, the president of Teaneck, New Jersey Board of Education, faced overwhelming public opinion in leading the Board in its decision to integrate Teaneck’s schools in 1964, making it the first “white” town in the nation to voluntarily do so.
During the 1950s and 1960s, middle class blacks had begun to move to Teaneck, predominately in the northeast section of town. Blockbusting and other scare tactics used by realtors caused a white exodus from those neighborhoods as more blacks moved in. Teaneck had a neighborhood school system in which students were assigned to schools based on where in town they lived, and Bryant Elementary School, which served the northeast section of town, was fast approaching a black majority in the early 1960s.  Black parents feared that this de facto segregation would lead to Bryant being stigmatized as a “Negro school,” accelerating the withdrawal of whites as well as causing high teacher turnover and reduced funding (Damerell, p. 158). The Board had passed measures allowing parents to voluntarily transfer their children to other schools without much success in altering the school’s racial makeup.  At the superintendent’s urging, the Board publicized three solutions that were being considered, including a plan to make Bryant a central sixth grade and bus the students from Bryant’s district in grades 1-5 to the other elementary schools. This proposal would prevent de facto segregation at Bryant and integrate every elementary school in Teaneck.  Countless parents were infuriated by the proposed plans and formed the Neighborhood School Association (NSA), denying that Teaneck had a problem of racial imbalance in its schools. This group would later put up a slate of candidates for the Board of Education in the 1964 election.
Teaneck’s Board of Education has nine trustees who are elected for staggered three-year terms with three seats on the Board elected each year.  Confer was the only trustee running for reelection; although he was in favor of integration, he avoided the issue, instead preferring to campaign on the abstraction of “quality education” (Damerell, p. 210). Confer came in third, winning reelection by only twenty-one votes.  He owed his victory to the third member of the NSA slate’s support for the schools’ budget, which lost her the endorsement of the Lower Taxes League.  Following the election, the Board chose Confer as its president. Overwhelming electoral support for the NSA slate had made clear that they could gain control of the Board the next year and that if an integration plan were to be passed, it would have to be done soon.
On May 13, 1964, the Board of Education held a public meeting at the high school. Fourteen hundred residents were jammed into the auditorium, most of them hostile to the central sixth grade integration plan. Although the NSA trustees had claimed that racial imbalance was nonexistent, declared a majority of Teaneck to be against compulsory busing for sixth graders, and threatened civil disobedience should the integration plan pass, the Board had informally passed the measure the previous night. Before the meeting began, Confer rose from his seat and offered encouragement to six other trustees who, with him, composed the majority. The NSA presented a petition with over five thousand signatures against the central sixth-grade plan. Dr. Harry Warner, an NSA trustee called it “the climax of a miscarriage of the democratic process that has been perpetuated on this tortured community these past many months” (Damerell, p.256).  Before a vote on the motion that Bryant become a sixth grade school, Confer rose from his seat and faced the belligerent crowd.  He read a prepared statement that said, “I personally have been disturbed that a number of people refuse to recognize a more issue in this situation…We have been a party to a history of discrimination against the Negro in housing…I say there is a moral issue and I challenge every citizen to admit it” (Damerell, p. 257). Then, he called for a vote in which the proposal passed 7-2. Following the vote, members of the enraged crowd jumped to their feet, some running towards the board members on stage.  It took several policemen and a fireman to restore order.  In the following weeks and months, Bernard Confer received threatening and profanity-laced phone calls. There was even one instance in which Confer’s six-year-old daughter picked up the phone and the caller yelled obscenities at her instead. Confer’s home required police protection.
The test as to whether integration would be in Teaneck to stay was the Board of Education elections in February 1965. If the NSA won, as it seemed they would, it would be not long before they reversed the integration decision, leaving the issue up to the courts to impose on Teaneck. The pro-integration slate, called the “Good Guys,” needed every vote to defeat the popular NSA and thus initiated a massive get out the vote effort to ensure their supporters would not stay home.  Once the central sixth grade became a fact on the ground, citizens of Teaneck had realized that it was not as bad as the NSA had predicted it would be. All three “Good Guys” won by almost 2,000 votes. A record 12,820 people cast votes in what The New York Times called “the bitterest school [fight] in the history of Bergen County” (Waggoner). Although Confer did not run for reelection two years later, he showed incredible courage by alienating his neighbors and enduring verbal abuse as well as the threat of physical harm to stand up for his principles.

"In the intricate tapestry of American political history, it is often those holding positions within the smaller echelons of power who most profoundly demonstrate the ideals of democracy. In a small but burgeoning town in Ohio, a decision made by a Board of Education member, Catherine Hargreaves, in the autumn of 1971 would serve as a testament to this truth, mirroring the courage of Bernard Confer's stand for school integration years earlier in Teaneck, New Jersey.
Fairview, Ohio, a town characterized by its quaint neighborhoods and a burgeoning population, was not immune to the racial tensions that simmered across the country. As African American families began moving into the southern districts of Fairview, a clear racial divide emerged in the local schools. The South Fairview Elementary School, once a beacon of community pride, stood on the verge of being labeled a ""black school,"" a designation many feared would usher in diminished resources and community disengagement.
Catherine Hargreaves, a librarian and the president of the Fairview Board of Education, faced the escalating issue head-on. The board was deeply divided on the matter, with some members staunchly opposing any mention of redistricting or busing. Hargreaves, however, believed in an integrated educational system that reflected the diversity of America itself.
Hargreaves, a soft-spoken woman known for her deliberate manner, had always championed the idea of ""education for all."" It was during a board meeting on a cool October evening that she laid out a daring plan: to restructure the district's schooling system to ensure an even racial distribution across all schools. This proposal included a busing plan that would transport students from various neighborhoods to different schools, thus integrating the classrooms.
Her announcement sent ripples through the community. The plan, though morally sound, was met with immediate backlash. A coalition of parents formed the ""Fairview Families Association"" (FFA), echoing the sentiments of the Neighborhood School Association from Teaneck. The FFA vehemently opposed Hargreaves' plan, organizing protests and flooding local newspapers with editorials decrying the proposed changes.
In the following weeks, Hargreaves and the Board faced an uphill battle. Town halls became battlegrounds, with passionate speeches from both sides. Hargreaves, facing personal attacks and a community divided, stood firm. She met with opposition leaders, listened to their fears, and addressed their concerns with empathy but remained unflinching in her resolve.
The vote on the integration plan was a scene of high drama, with hundreds of Fairview residents crowding the boardroom and spilling out into the chilly streets. When the motion passed by a narrow margin, Hargreaves' calm exterior belied the turmoil she felt within. The FFA vowed to overturn the decision and began to rally support for the next Board election, targeting Hargreaves and her allies.
The year that followed was trying for Hargreaves. She received anonymous threats, her property was vandalized, and she became a figure of contempt for those who once celebrated her service. Despite this, she remained visible in the community, attending every school event and board meeting, resolute in the rightness of her actions.
The 1972 Board of Education election was a referendum on Hargreaves' vision for Fairview. Dubbed the ""Unity Slate,"" Hargreaves and her supporters faced off against the FFA-endorsed candidates in what became one of the most contentious local elections in Ohio's history. Voter turnout shattered records, and to the surprise of many, the Unity Slate triumphed, securing a clear mandate for the integration plan.
Catherine Hargreaves' stance and subsequent victory proved pivotal. Fairview's schools became models of successful integration, lauded by state officials and educators alike. While Hargreaves chose not to seek re-election, preferring to return to her quieter life of service, her legacy was cemented. Her courage in the face of intense opposition, much like Bernard Confer's, demonstrated an unwavering commitment to the principles of equity and justice. Her story, while not widely known beyond the borders of Ohio, serves as an enduring example of the impact one person can have when they stand firm in their convictions, for the betterment of their community and the future of its children.",1,2004
"In Humboldt County, California, the Pacific Lumber Company puts bread on the table for most of the area’s residents. As the region’s largest and most influential private-employer,1 Pacific Lumber employs nearly 900 workers and generates over $54 million in business activities.2 Thus, when Humboldt County District Attorney Paul V. Gallegos decided to challenge the Pacific Lumber Company just weeks after winning his own election, many people believed that he was committing political suicide.3 However, in the face of a vicious recall campaign, Gallegos acted with the courage of his convictions.
In 1999, Pacific Lumber agreed to the Headwaters Forest settlement in which it would sell 5,600 acres of land to the state as a public trust for $480 million. In return, the company would be allowed to log the remaining 211,000 acres, although it would have to follow a strict set of environmental restrictions.4 However, it was later discovered that the company had lied to state officials about the risk of cutting down trees on unstable slopes in order to make an additional profit of $40 million per year. Richard Wilson, the Department of Forestry’s director, stated that if he had been given accurate information, he would not have sanctioned the company’s logging plan.5 A panel of seven scientists who were employed by the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board also issued a scathing condemnation of the company’s blatant disregard for environmental protection.6 According to the panel, the corporation’s logging had resulted in the degradation of water quality and the destruction of habitats for salmon and other endangered animals. Rancher Michael Evenson described the devastating outcome: “Their clear-cutting has caused massive landslides, and that has filled up the river with silt and gravel.”7
The company’s disregard for the environment was nothing new. In 1998 alone, Pacific Lumber had been cited for fourteen violations of state forestry laws.8 However, since the corporation employed many residents and retained an enormous amount of influence, legislators and politicians turned a blind eye to the situation. In 2003, a judge concurred with the Humboldt Watershed Council that Pacific Lumber had violated environmental regulations, but refused to penalize the corporation or even slow down its logging.9 Furthermore, the California Fish and Game Department did nothing to punish the company.10
Only six weeks after barely winning the local election against the twenty-year incumbent, the new district attorney, Paul V. Gallegos, risked his political career when he became the first elected official to ever confront the timber giant.11 His office sued Pacific Lumber on the grounds that the corporation had provided the state with deliberately fabricated information regarding the potential environmental impact of its logging. The six- count litigation12 asserted that the company’s misleading attempt to generate a greater profit had “caused destruction to ancient redwoods, serious harm to Humboldt Bay, and serious harm to streams, bridges, roads, homes, and property rights of Humboldt County.”13 Moreover, Gallegos sought an additional $2,500 for each tree that was cut, a lawsuit that had the potential of costing the corporation over $250 million.14 When asked about his decision to pursue the case, Gallegos responded, “Government needs to represent and treat everyone equal. Whenever you have businesses engaged in unlawful fraudulent activity…it affects the overall integrity in our systems. We cannot have two levels of justice in Humboldt County. That is how simple it is.”15
The district attorney’s actions were met with bitter opposition. In retaliation, Pacific Lumber launched a vicious recall campaign against Gallegos, and poured over $300,000 into the effort.16 This was more than 90% of the total money going into the recall attempt.17 Pacific Lumber sent out thousands of pro-recall letters to Humboldt County residents, granted employees paid leave to campaign against the district attorney, falsely accused Gallegos of being “soft on crime,” and paid professional circulators eight dollars for each signature they could add to the recall petition.18
For months, the antipathy against Gallegos was ubiquitous. Almost everywhere he went, the district attorney would see signs and bumper stickers that read “Recall Paul Gallegos.” Loggers began to protest outside of the courtroom,19 and long time supporters of the district attorney began to turn against him. Melvin Berti, the mayor of Fortuna, remarked, “My wife and I voted for Paul Gallegos. Unfortunately, now we see what his true platform is.”20 In addition, the county’s supervisors voted 4-1 against providing his office with additional funding to handle the case.21 Gallegos’s house was even broken into twice, and e-mails from his office were stolen.22
Gallegos, though, retained his faith in the voters and the political system. Despite the fact that Pacific Lumber had vigorously campaigned to remove Gallegos, the voters ultimately decided to keep the district attorney, 61% to 39%. Gallegos exultingly stated, “It’s a triumph of the people over the influence of money and lies in politics.”23 The district attorney’s office is continuing its lawsuit against Pacific Lumber.
The district attorney could have easily avoided the firestorm that resulted from his decision to pursue Pacific Lumber. Instead, Gallegos disregarded the consequences that had put his career in limbo and acted with the courage of his convictions. As retired Humboldt County science teacher Ralph Kraus noted, “The D.A. [district attorney] is showing the kind of integrity and courage that should be a giant moral inspiration to all citizens, and rejuvenate our faith that with the right people in office, the system can work.”24 District Attorney Paul V. Gallegos’s courageous actions marked a turning point in the dominance of the timber company’s interests in the county, and reflect a man who was willing to act on principle and not politics.

"In the verdant expanse of Cascade County, Oregon, the timber industry reigned supreme, its roots entwined deeply with the community’s economy and its cultural identity. At the heart of this green empire stood Douglas Timber, a company that single-handedly kept the county afloat. Its logging operations provided jobs for a substantial portion of the county's populace and contributed millions to the local economy. So, when Cascade County's newly-elected District Attorney, Sarah Jensen, mounted a legal crusade against Douglas Timber for its environmental violations, many deemed it a brazen act of defiance that could spell the end of her nascent political journey.
Douglas Timber, much like Pacific Lumber, had committed a series of environmental infractions that ran afoul of state and federal regulations. From the majestic heights of Cascade’s old-growth forests to the life-giving rivers that snaked through the county, the company’s relentless logging practices began to erode the natural splendor that defined the region. However, Douglas Timber’s deep pockets and influence had effectively silenced any substantive governmental scrutiny. Regulatory agencies had delivered nothing more than slaps on the wrist, leaving the company's practices largely unchecked.
It was in the winter of 2000 when Sarah Jensen, a newcomer to the political arena with a background in environmental law, stepped into the role of District Attorney. Her campaign, which had narrowly upended the 15-year tenure of the incumbent, hadn’t focused on environmental issues. Yet, what she encountered upon taking office could not leave her conscience at rest.
Six weeks into her term, Jensen made a decision that would embroil her in one of the most contentious legal battles in the state’s history. Her office filed suit against Douglas Timber, citing a pattern of deliberate misrepresentation regarding the environmental impact of their logging operations and seeking reparations for the damage incurred upon Cascade County’s natural habitats.
The lawsuit’s allegations were damning, enumerating numerous incidents where Douglas Timber’s practices had precipitated landslides, compromised salmon runs, and desecrated pristine woodland watersheds. The litigation sought not only a cessation of these harmful activities but also punitive damages that would fund the restoration of the affected areas.
The response from Douglas Timber was swift and severe. A recall campaign against Jensen began to coalesce, bankrolled by the company's vast financial resources. The timber giant poured more than a quarter of a million dollars into the recall effort, an unprecedented sum for local politics.
The county was inundated with anti-Jensen propaganda. Billboards, radio spots, and a barrage of mailers painted her as a radical environmentalist, out of touch with the economic realities of Cascade County. Douglas Timber's employees, many of whom had familial ties to the company dating back generations, were incensed. They saw Jensen’s actions not just as an attack on their employer but as an existential threat to their way of life.
Jensen's home became a target of vandalism, and her office was subjected to a series of break-ins. Her allies dwindled as the recall’s momentum grew, the political establishment distancing itself from her increasingly isolated stand. Yet, amidst the tempest of public and private hostility, Jensen remained resolute.
When the recall vote was finally held, the pundits' predictions of Jensen's imminent political demise proved to be unfounded. The voters of Cascade County, by a significant majority, chose to retain their District Attorney. Jensen's victory was seen as a triumph of principle over corporate might, of long-term environmental stewardship over short-term economic gains.
The lawsuit against Douglas Timber proceeded, eventually resulting in a landmark settlement that mandated the company adhere to stringent environmental standards and contribute to the restoration of damaged ecosystems. Jensen’s stand galvanized the environmental movement not just in Cascade County but across the nation, inspiring similar actions against corporations that flouted ecological laws.
In the wake of her victory, Jensen’s reputation was transformed. No longer just a local District Attorney, she became a symbol of the power of public office to effect change, even against formidable odds. Her integrity and courage in the face of overwhelming corporate influence echoed the actions of Paul Gallegos in Humboldt County and became a beacon for environmental advocates everywhere. Her story is a powerful reminder that even in the face of potential self-destruction, one individual’s steadfast commitment to justice can prevail and leave an indelible mark on the fabric of society.",1,2005
"In 1956, when John F. Kennedy wrote Profiles in Courage, he asserted that elected officials have an obligation to “lead, inform, correct and sometimes even ignore constituent opinion” if doing so serves the nation’s best interest (Kennedy, 15). Seven years later, the truth of these words was demonstrated when President Kennedy called upon Ivan Allen, Jr., the mayor of Atlanta, to testify in support of the groundbreaking civil rights legislation he was urging Congress to enact.  In making this request, President Kennedy set the stage for Mayor Allen to examine his conscience, defy the opinions of many contemporaries, and take a brave stand against segregation.  
The President’s selection of Ivan Allen, Jr. as a witness was a logical choice.  Although Allen was a grandson of a Confederate cavalryman and had unsuccessfully run for governor of Georgia on a pro-segregation platform in the early 1950s, his civic involvement since then had caused him to reevaluate his beliefs on race relations.  In 1961, as President of Atlanta’s Chamber of Commerce, Allen helped black leaders and white businessmen reach an agreement to end segregation at downtown lunch counters (Suggs).  Later that year, when Allen was elected mayor, he received the majority of black votes.  Once in office, he removed the “colored” and “white” register signs from City Hall, gave black policemen the power to arrest whites, appointed the first black firemen, and ordered the desegregation of city ballparks and swimming pools. However, his first years in office were not perfect with respect to race relations.  He erected (but later tore down) physical barricades between a black neighborhood and a white neighborhood in southwest Atlanta in an attempt to halt “blockbusting” by black realtors.  But overall, in his efforts to have Atlanta seen by the outside world— and by itself—as “the city too busy to hate,” Allen had done more than any other Southern politician to advance racial equality (Hyatt).  
In June 1963, President Kennedy urged Congress to issue a major new law, a civil rights bill that would eliminate discrimination in restaurants and hotels and other public facilities.  In early July, Kennedy contacted Mayor Allen and asked him to testify in support of the legislation.  Allen was proud that the President had called upon him, but he felt that his testimony would not be important enough to help the bill pass.  He also worried that actively supporting the law would cost him re-election, because many voters in Atlanta opposed the legislation (Pomerantz, 315-318). 
However, as the Mayor studied the proposed law, he found he wanted to work to support it.  He believed that voluntary desegregation had accomplished as much as it could, and that direction from the federal government was necessary if  further steps to racial equality were to take place.  Allen met with black community leaders to discuss his growing desire to speak publicly in favor of the law.  Martin Luther King, Sr. and several other black leaders urged him not to testify, telling him he was “too valuable to sacrifice” by giving testimony that might not be necessary for the law to pass   (Pomerantz, 319).  Finally, Allen’s wife put into words the result of all his thinking.  She told him, “You’ll have a hard time living with yourself the rest of your life if you don’t do it….I don’t think you can be re-elected if you do go, but if you feel its right, then go and accept the consequences.” (Pomerantz, 318).     
On July 26, 1963, Ivan Allen, Jr. appeared in Washington to testify in support of the Civil Rights Act.  Traditionally, United States senators introduced witnesses from their home state, but because both senators from Georgia opposed the bill they were absent from the proceedings. (Suggs). Instead, Charles Weltner, a junior congressman from Georgia, introduced Allen. [1]  Mayor Allen testified that in Atlanta specific problems had been solved by the cooperation of people of  both races.  He said, though, that further action was necessary, but could not take place without federal legislation.  He  also warned that Congress’s failure to pass the bill would be seen as endorsing discrimination by private businesses (Barry). Finally, he called segregation “slavery’s stepchild” and urged Congress to “make every American free in fact as well as in theory” (Pomerantz, 321).        
Most newspapers in Georgia wrote editorials blasting the legislation and Allen’s testimony in its support.  He received many hateful and vicious letters condemning him for endorsing the bill. Writers called him “Benedict Arnold” and suggested he “do the city of Atlanta a favor and jump” from his executive office (Pomerantz, 320-21).  However, opinion changed fairly quickly – by the time the Civil Rights Act of 1964 became law, one year after Allen’s testimony and eight months after President Kennedy’s assassination, Atlanta was much more positive about the role the Mayor had played.  When Allen ran for re-election later that year, he received a majority of votes from both black and white residents of Atlanta (Martin). 
Ivan Allen, Jr. was the only prominent Southern politician to testify in behalf of the Civil Rights Act (Martin). In doing so, he lost the favor of many friends and constituents, and he risked his political career.  Fortunately, he was re-elected, and was able to guide Atlanta in its transition to equal rights, putting into practice the principles he had so bravely testified to before Congress. As one historian noted after Mayor Allen’s death on July 3, 2003, the mayor served as a “human bridge”, carrying many in the South away from discriminatory attitudes and actions and towards a more egalitarian society (Martin). 
[1] Congressman Weltner continued to be a strong supporter of civil rights. In 1966, when Lester Maddox, an advocate of segregation, became his party’s nominee for governor, Weltner chose to withdraw from his own race for re-election rather than support Maddox or violate the oath of loyalty he had signed to support his party’s candidates. He received the JFK Profiles in Courage Award in 1991. www.jfklibrary/org/pica-recipients.html.",0,2005
"In a political climate where the public often regards elected officials with skepticism, it's the actions of the dedicated few that can restore faith in leadership. This was the case with Mayor Christine Anderson of Springfield, Illinois, who, in the spring of 1974, faced the challenging task of navigating the city through the contentious issue of school desegregation.
Much like Ivan Allen, Jr., Anderson came from a background that might have predisposed her to maintain the status quo. Her grandfather had been a prominent businessman in Springfield, and her early political views had skewed towards conservatism. However, as she rose through the ranks of local politics, becoming mayor in a hard-fought election, her perspectives broadened. Once in office, Anderson initiated several low-profile reforms aimed at promoting racial equality, including diversifying city government and improving public services in predominantly African American neighborhoods.
The true test of her commitment came when a federal court ordered Springfield to desegregate its public schools. The city, divided along racial lines due to years of informal segregation, saw Anderson's response to this mandate as the litmus test of her administration. Like Allen, she recognized that while her actions might alienate many of her supporters and potentially end her political career, it was a necessary step towards justice and equality.
Faced with vehement opposition from a significant portion of her voter base and pressure from within her party, Mayor Anderson stood firm in her resolve. She worked closely with the local NAACP, education activists, and community leaders to develop a desegregation plan that was both effective and sensitive to the concerns of all Springfield's citizens.
In a series of public forums, she faced hostile crowds and bitter criticisms but maintained a dignified composure, echoing Allen's moral clarity and determination. ""It is not merely about compliance with the law,"" she asserted, ""but about the kind of city we want to be."" Her stance, like Allen's, was not without personal consequence. Anderson endured vitriolic attacks in the press and even threats to her safety.
Yet, when the time came to implement the desegregation plan, Mayor Anderson's advocacy ensured its passage. The subsequent city elections would serve as a referendum on her leadership during this turbulent period. Against all odds, much like Allen, Anderson won reelection, thanks in large part to a newly galvanized African American electorate and a segment of white voters who respected her courage.
Mayor Anderson's leadership during the desegregation crisis marked a turning point for Springfield. Under her guidance, the city took significant steps toward becoming a more inclusive community. While she did not seek the spotlight, her role as an agent of change in Springfield was later recognized by historians who noted that, akin to Allen, she served as a bridge guiding many away from the prejudices of the past toward a shared vision of equality.
The story of Mayor Christine Anderson, much like Mayor Ivan Allen, Jr., is a powerful narrative about the impact of principled leadership and the transformative power of courage in the face of adversity. It is a reminder that the true measure of public service is not found in the ease of decision-making, but in the willingness to make tough choices that forge a better future for all.",1,2005
"In 1995, Mark Hatfield, Senator from Oregon, cast the decisive vote against the Balanced Budget Amendment to the United States Constitution. Had the amendment passed, the federal government’s power to use deficit spending would have come to an end. Any program that relies on discretionary spending—from Social Security to Head Start—would have faced unpredictable cuts, causing untold suffering to the poor, the aged, and the young. The amendment—the “number one priority” of the  new  Republican majority in Washington, D.C., the first since President Eisenhower’s administration in 1953—was a hairsbreadth away from the required two-thirds vote in the Senate.1 Despite the call for party unity, Senator Hatfield would not say yes, refusing even to abstain. “I cannot in good conscience,” Hatfield stated, “vote for the amendment [and] forever alter the way our Constitution is interpreted.”2 The only Republican to break with party, Hatfield voted on principle, risking, as John F. Kennedy would put it, “his own career—for the national good.”3
The importance of the Balanced Budget Amendment to party politics highlights Senator Hatfield’s courage. As the “centerpiece” of the Republican agenda in the 1990s4—the Contract with America—the amendment responded to concerns that the federal government was spiraling out of control. Putting a brake on deficit spending, the amendment would have imposed debt limits on the federal government to halt discretionary expenditures. Although fiscal restraint may be a virtue, the amendment raised serious questions about democracy and economics. Robert Reischauer, former director of the Congressional Budget Office, warned that such an amendment “could  lead to distortions of policies simply to meet budget goals”5 for it would compel legislators to cut funding for social programs just when the economy was weakest—at  the time of greatest need.  Moreover, the amendment could trigger government default  by increasing the cost of borrowing. But the Republican leadership, calling the proposal “absolutely essential,” made amending the Constitution its major goal.6
The Republicans controlled Congress, but held only 53 seats in the Senate. Every vote mattered. Senator Hatfield, however, opposed “enshrining fiscal policy in the constitution.”7 Indeed, he dismissed the amendment as “a political ploy to erroneously make Americans think [the government was] actually doing something about the deficit.”8 But on all sides he faced pressure to change his mind. Hatfield’s “colleagues leaned on him, lobbyists pressured him.””9 Senators Dole and Hatch,  Hatfield’s  longtime friends, urged party loyalty.10 The fact that Dole was a candidate for President heightened the importance of his request. In addition, the Republican leadership dispatched Dr. Robert Schuler, “the well-known television minister,” to persuade the Senator on grounds of faith.11 Even Hatfield’s son-in-law, counsel to Senator Hatch, lobbied him, presenting him with a photograph of his own granddaughter with the words “For Her Sake!” written on it.12
The amendment easily passed in the House of Representatives, 300-132, but its chances in the Senate were far from clear. The Republican leadership, hopeful that Hatfield would fall in line, postponed the day of the Senate roll call to give him time to come on board. In the final hours, Hatfield received almost a dozen phone calls urging party support. Senator Dole personally met with him for twenty minutes.13 So strongly did the Senator oppose the amendment that he offered to resign rather than vote in its favor.14 Although eleven Democrats joined with 55 Republicans, the amendment’s passage fell short—Senator Hatfield voted no, with a final tally of 65-35 (in Senate tradition, the Senate majority leader changed his vote once the measure failed to be able to bring it up for reconsideration).15
In Profiles in Courage, JFK observed: “In no other occupation but politics, is it expected that a man will sacrifice honors, prestige and his chosen career on a single issue.”16 Immediately, Republican colleagues called for Hatfield to resign as Chief of the Senate Appropriations Committee—a position of extraordinary importance.17 Senator Trent Lott called Hatfield “arrogant”; 18 others dubbed him “a poor excuse for a Republican.”19 Alphonse D’Amato, former senator from New York, urged the GOP to withhold campaign funds from Hatfield.20 But in the wake of his decision, Senator Hatfield showed “grace under pressure,”21 remaining respectfully silent against his critics even as a special caucus convened to discuss his fate. In the end, the Senator retained his chairmanship. But the next year he chose not to run for another term.
In opposing the amendment, Hatfield displayed the special political courage that JFK described: as a “conscientious insurgent,”22 Hatfield confronted not only “the pressures of party responsibility,” but also pressures from his longtime political friends, his faith, and his family.23 His stand against the Balanced Budget Amendment came at  the end of a long political career in which he showed himself to be no stranger either to controversy or to principle. He opposed the war in Vietnam. He urged amnesty for those who refused to fight in the war. He called for a nuclear freeze.24 His vote against the amendment may seem less heroic for the issue of a budget cap appears technical and legalistic. But the amendment would have radically altered the way government does business—the federal government would not have had financial discretion to deal with tragedies such as Hurricane Katrina or the threat of avian flu. Moreover, as the “rallying cry of the Republican Revolution,”25 the amendment demanded party loyalty in terms  that few elected officials could have resisted.
On the news of the Senator’s retirement, Senator Dodd singled out Hatfield’s stand against the Balanced Budget Amendment as one of the Senator’s exemplary acts of principle: he “was the sole Republican to vote against the . . . amendment, and he would have paid dearly for that stand had the concept of respect for one’s conscience not prevailed.”26 The concept of respect that did prevail owes much to Senator Hatfield’s political courage and the standard of decency he set for the nation.

"At the dawn of the new millennium, when budget surpluses turned the tide of public opinion in favor of fiscal conservatism, Senator Elizabeth Norton of Maine found herself at the epicenter of a national debate that would test her political mettle and moral compass. In the year 2000, as a newly proposed Fiscal Responsibility Amendment threatened to upend decades of economic policy, Norton stood as a bulwark against the wave of enthusiasm that swept through Congress.
The Fiscal Responsibility Amendment, akin to the Balanced Budget Amendment of the 1990s, promised an era of disciplined spending and an end to the government's perceived fiscal profligacy. With the national debt soaring and the public's anxiety over economic security at an all-time high, the amendment garnered widespread support from both sides of the aisle. It was championed as a safeguard against the economic shortsightedness that had plagued previous administrations and was the crowning jewel of the Conservative Renaissance agenda.
Senator Norton, however, saw beyond the surface appeal of the amendment. A seasoned economist before her tenure in the Senate, she understood the nuances of fiscal policy and the need for government flexibility in times of crisis. The amendment, she argued, would handcuff the nation's ability to respond to economic downturns, natural disasters, and unforeseen emergencies. It threatened to do more harm than good, potentially exacerbating recessions by forcing cuts to vital programs when they were most needed.
The pressures mounting on Senator Norton were immense. The Conservative Renaissance saw her as the key to the amendment's passage, given her influence and the respect she commanded in economic matters. Her party leaders implored her to endorse the amendment, and lobbyists descended upon her office, presenting doomsday scenarios of unchecked government spending and imploring her to act for the sake of fiscal sanity.
In an atmosphere fraught with political brinkmanship, Senator Norton chose to stand alone. Echoing the principled dissent of Senator Mark Hatfield, she refused to bow to the demands of party unity at the expense of public welfare. ""Fiscal responsibility,"" she declared, ""does not mean shackling our hands. It means the thoughtful, strategic management of resources, with an eye on both the present needs and future exigencies.""
The day of the vote was marked by palpable tension. As the roll call echoed through the chamber of the Senate, Norton's ""nay"" was not just a vote against a piece of legislation, but a declaration of her commitment to the broader principles of economic prudence and democratic governance.
The fallout from her decision was swift and merciless. Senator Norton faced scorn from her colleagues, vitriol from the media, and the wrath of a constituency fed a steady diet of fiscal doomsaying. Yet, even as her political future dimmed, Norton's conviction remained steadfast.
In the ensuing midterm elections, Senator Norton's seat was fiercely contested. She campaigned not on the promise of easy answers but on the courage to embrace complex truths. To the surprise of many political pundits, Norton secured her reelection, buoyed by a citizenry that came to appreciate her candor and the depth of her economic acumen.
In the twilight of her political career, Senator Elizabeth Norton's legacy was defined not by the number of bills she passed but by the singular stand she took against the Fiscal Responsibility Amendment. She reminded the nation that courage in public office is not about yielding to the winds of prevailing sentiment but about standing firm in the storm, guided by a compass of principle and foresight. Norton's story, much like Hatfield's, serves as a poignant reminder that the true measure of leadership is often found in the willingness to walk the difficult path of dissent when conscience demands it.",1,2006
"On January 29th of 1969, Shirley Chisholm walked up to the well on the floor of the House of Representatives and began to speak. “ …I think it would be hard to imagine an assignment that is less relevant to my background or to the needs of the predominantly black and Puerto Rican people who elected me, many of whom are unemployed, hungry, and badly housed, than the one I was given” (Chisholm, 1970, p.84). The freshman congresswoman from Bedford-Stuyvesant had been assigned to the Agriculture Committee, on the subcommittee for rural development and forestry.
Chisholm’s reaction was “Apparently all they know about Brooklyn here in Washington is that a tree grew there” (Madden, 1969). By audaciously challenging her committee assignment, Chisholm risked her future success in Congress to fight for her convictions and for her constituents.
In the 1960's, Bedford-Stuyvesant was largely composed of blacks and other minorities. It was one of the poorest, most dangerous, and least policed districts in New York. The New York Times reported on a Justice Department study of the narcotics and gambling industry in the district. It revealed that “organized crime was grossing more revenue….in Bedford-Stuyvesant than the Federal Government was collecting in income taxes from the area” (Burnham, 1972). Chisholm ran for Congress intent on improving these miserable conditions.
When Chisholm arrived in Washington in 1968, the House was a place for the powerful to gain more power and the freshmen to watch and learn. Power was gained by cultivating relationships with other representatives and obtaining positions on important “money” committees. The leadership had enormous influence on committee assignments and overall influence of a legislator. The future of a congressman in the House and in politics depended on one’s ability to please the leadership. So congressmen, particularly freshmen, rarely objected to their committee assignments. From 1925 to 1959, only two ever raised the issue. (Goodwin, 1959)
The seniority system began as a way to fight the establishment, but instead became an integral part of it. In 1911, a group of congressmen revolted against the powerful Speaker of the House, Joseph Cannon. They took away his right to appoint committee chairs and members and established the seniority rule as a safeguard against the Speaker’s total authority. However, this safeguard created its own problems. George Goodwin (1959) noted in his paper on seniority that there is a “lack of any dependable relation between seniority and qualified leadership” (p.418).
Shirley Chisholm realized that to make desperately needed changes for her constituents, she had to challenge the seniority system and work on a committee relevant to her district’s issues. Chisholm learned that she had been assigned to the Agriculture Committee. She was further assigned to the subcommittee on rural development and forestry, which could have no conceivable impact on her district. So Chisholm objected. She first spoke with the Speaker, John McCormack, who asked the chairmen of the Ways and Means and the Agriculture Committees for a change of subcommittee. Her request was rebuffed. McCormack told her “Mrs. Chisholm, this is the way it is…You have to be a good soldier.” Chisholm responded “All my forty-three years I have been a good soldier…The time is growing late, and I can’t be a good soldier any longer” (Chisholm, 1970, p. 82-83). Next, Chisholm attempted to make a motion on the floor to reconsider her assignment. “Every time I rose, two or three men jumped up” (ibid, p. 83). The seniority system foiled her once again, as senior members are always recognized first.
The Congresswoman persevered. She walked to the front of the room and began to speak. She exposed the discrepancy between the black population and black representation in Congress; only nine black members were in place, when over fifty should have been. Chisholm told the House that these nine members should be “where they can work effectively to help this nation meet its critical problems of racism, deprivation, and urban decay” (Madden, 1969). She then presented a resolution instructing the Committee on Committees to find a new committee assignment more pertinent to her district and experience. The amendment eventually passed and Chisholm was placed on the Veterans’ Affairs Committee. Risking the respect of her colleagues and her future in Congress, Shirley Chisholm had challenged the seniority system and won.
Her response, “There are a lot more veterans in my district than trees” (Chisholm, 1970, p.86).
Shirley Chisholm continued to serve her district faithfully. She spoke out against the Vietnam War, against the draft, on behalf of the ERA, and in favor of legalizing abortion. She became honorary president of NARAL, taking a stand on a contentious issue. She pushed for a national holiday honoring Martin Luther King Jr. in every legislative session until it passed in 1983. She sponsored bills to halt the importation of Rhodesian Chrome, to help Cuban and Haitian refugees, to consider child nutrition in schools, and to aid Indian families. She used her experience as a teacher to back more funding for schools and daycare.
In 1972, Chisholm made a bid for the Democratic nomination for president. She defied the Black Caucus, who attempted to abort her run. She risked her dignity and even her life, surviving assassination attempts and personal attacks to allow future minority candidates to have an opportunity. “The door is not open yet, but it is ajar” (Chisholm, 1973, p.4).
When Shirley Chisholm decided to question the system, she did it with reason.
She requested a change in the seniority system so she could have a positive impact on the district she represented. She challenged the idea that representatives can only help their district with pork barrel politics, and insisted on making concrete changes to help the underprivileged. She risked the esteem and popularity that comes with quietly following tradition and, like John Quincy Adams, “neither sought nor was offered political alliances or influence” (Kennedy, 1956, p.39). Shirley Chisholm boldly protested a flawed system and risked her political future for what she believed was right.",0,2007
"On December 11, 2007, members of the United States Sentencing Commission voted unanimously to make a groundbreaking change in one of their policies. They decided that the disparity between sentences for crack cocaine crimes and those involving powder cocaine was exceedingly unjust and prejudiced. With crack users being predominantly black and powder cocaine users predominantly white, the Sentencing Commission judged the much harsher sentences for crack users to be racially biased at their core (Grow, 2007). The Commission will therefore allow the sentences of thousands currently imprisoned for crack cocaine violations to be appealed before federal judges beginning in March 2008, in an effort to retroactively shorten these sentences where feasible (U.S. Sentencing Commission, 2007). While this represents a major innovative step toward racial equality and justice, one uncelebrated, independent woman put her entire career on the line for this very same issue--seventeen years ago.
Judge Pamela Alexander, currently serving as judge for the Hennepin County District Court in Minnesota, has repeatedly blazed trails into uncharted territory to achieve her goals. Born in 1952, Alexander grew up in an African-American family in Minneapolis. Her father, a bus driver, and her mother, a housewife, raised six children, with Pamela being the youngest. From a young age, Alexander glowed with a fiery ambition, and decided at age 12, after testifying at a rape trial, that she wanted to direct this ambition toward a law career. Her determination led her to become the first in her family to attend college. Upon graduating from Augsburg College in 1974, she continued to follow her dream of becoming a lawyer who truly cared about her clients, and ultimately received her J.D. in 1977 from the University of Minnesota Law School. Alexander embraced her new profession with a passionate competence that captured the attention of her peers. Watching her capably defend her mostly poor and indigent clients, fellow Legal Rights Court attorney Michael Davis (1993) remarked that he “saw, first hand, her dedication in ensuring each client received the highest quality legal representation” (para. 3). In 1981, Pamela Alexander became the first African-American female prosecutor in the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office, and then set yet another precedent by becoming the first African-American woman and the youngest attorney to serve as a judge in Hennepin County (Davis, 1993).
Judge Alexander had the world at her fingertips, with seemingly limitless opportunities in her future. That is, until 1990, when the newly elected judge, unwavering in her determination to dispense justice in accordance with the constitutions of her state and her country, made a monumental and controversial ruling. In the case State v Russell, five African-American defendants, including Gerald Russell, stood before Judge Alexander, each threatened with a 20-year prison term. The State had charged the men with possessing three or more grams of crack cocaine. While having up to ten grams of powder cocaine would result in a five-year sentence at most, the possession of three or more grams of crack cocaine could, by Minnesota law, lead to a sentence of 20 years (Alexander and Gyamerah, 1997, p. 97). Judge Alexander agreed with the defense argument that this statute was racially biased, since 92.3 percent of people charged with possessing crack cocaine were black and 85.1 percent of people charged with powder cocaine possession were white (Levine and Reinarman, 1997, p. 240). Knowing her decision could be injurious to her career, Alexander ruled that the sentencing law represented a blatant violation of constitutionally guaranteed equal rights protection and dismissed the charges. She stated:
There has been a recent outcry in this country for control of drugs. This concern has led to a rash of new laws with tough penalties designed [to] aid in this ‘war.’ While the concern of the nation is justified, the reactionary impulses that have come from the legislatures, in this case the Minnesota legislature, do not necessarily get to the root of the problem.
These actions must be kept in perspective and shouldn’t be instituted at the expense of basic civil rights…There is no justifiable reason to uphold a statute which results in such unequal treatment of similarly situated individuals. The [C]onstitution is designed to prevent this type of injustice” (qtd in Davis, 1993, para. 5).
In rendering her opinion, Judge Alexander refused to be swayed by the impassioned national antidrug movement of the late 1980s (Levine and Reinarman, 1997, p. 1), but instead rightfully based her decision on constitutional law.
The following year, the Minnesota Supreme Court upheld Judge Alexander’s decision, ruling that the sentencing statute was unconstitutional under Article 1, Section 2 and 16 of the Minnesota Constitution that provides citizens with the inherent right to “equal and impartial laws which govern the whole community and each member thereof” (State v Russell, 1999). However, Pamela Alexander’s ruling did not gain favor nationwide, as the country was immersed in its antidrug war. In fact, the Minnesota Court chose to equalize the cocaine sentencing disparities by increasing the terms of powder cocaine defendants (Appendix C, 2007).
It took an act of bravery for Alexander to rule in a way that sympathized with crack users during this era of American history, and she certainly paid the price. In 1993, Senator Paul Wellstone nominated Judge Alexander to be a U.S. district court judge under the Clinton administration. For two long years, Alexander traveled back and forth between Minnesota and D.C., where she was interviewed by various people, including agents of the F.B.I. Of this trying experience, Alexander said that, for those two years, “she dangled in the wind” (Grow, 2007). Despite Wellstone’s unfaltering support, the Clinton administration did not want to accept an “activist” judge who some saw as soft on crime (Grow, 2007). Standing firm in her belief in equal constitutional protection for comparable drug offenders in an era of antidrug fervor, “willing to sacrifice honors, prestige, and [her] chosen career on a single issue” (Kennedy, 1956, p. 7), Judge Alexander never became a federal judge. Despite the hardships she faced from her ruling in State v. Russell, Alexander never regretted the courageous decision that greatly stunted her promising career. Now, seventeen years later, as she sees her efforts finally making a difference, she can proudly say, “It’s about time” (Grow, 2007).",0,2008
"In a political landscape often shadowed by self-interest and partisanship, true acts of valor emerge when elected officials dare to defy not only the opposition but also the established norms of their own ranks. This was epitomized by the audacious stance of Representative Elena Torres, who, upon her election to represent the historically underprivileged district of Eastmont in California, confronted a system steeped in inertia and tradition.
Eastmont, much like Shirley Chisholm's Bedford-Stuyvesant, was a mosaic of disenfranchised communities, predominantly Latino, where the shadows of poverty and neglect were long. The district was beset with issues that ranged from dilapidated schools to inadequate healthcare services. When Torres arrived in Washington in 1980, her fiery spirit and resolve to uplift her community were set against a congressional culture that favored silent acquiescence over radical action, especially from newcomers.
In a surprising turn, Torres was assigned to the Committee on Natural Resources, specifically to a subcommittee that dealt with national parks—a role deemed incongruous to the urban-centric challenges of her district. Torres's reaction was swift and fierce: ""They've confused Eastmont's need for green spaces with a need for green legislation,"" she would later recount in her memoirs.
Rejecting the notion that a freshman congresswoman should wait her turn, Torres mounted a challenge against the confining tradition of committee assignments determined more by rote and routine than relevance. Drawing inspiration from Chisholm's journey some years prior, Torres demanded a reassignment to a committee where she could directly address urban poverty, education, and immigration—issues that were daily realities for her constituents.
Her boldness was met with a mix of astonishment and irritation. The House leadership, unaccustomed to such defiance from a junior member, warned of the potential consequences, hinting at isolation and a quick end to what could have been a promising political career.
Torres, undeterred, took her cause to the floor of the House. Echoing Chisholm, she argued, ""Representation without relevance is an empty gesture. I was not sent to Washington to oversee the trees but to nurture the seeds of change for Eastmont."" She called for a reevaluation of the seniority system, describing it as a relic that often prevented the most pressing issues from being addressed by those most passionate about them.
After days of deliberation and public intrigue, the committee chair relented. Torres's resolute stand and compelling argumentation swayed opinion in her favor, resulting in her reassignment to the Committee on Education and Labor. It was a monumental victory, not just for Torres but for all representatives who felt stymied by an antiquated system.
Torres's tenure in Congress was marked by fearless advocacy for her district's needs. She worked tirelessly for increased funding for education, championed immigrant rights, and introduced legislation to address the systemic disparities affecting her community.
In 1984, when Torres sought reelection, her defiance in the face of the establishment became the cornerstone of her campaign. The people of Eastmont, inspired by her tenacity, returned her to office with an overwhelming majority, affirming their belief in her mission and methods.
Representative Elena Torres, like Shirley Chisholm before her, left an indelible mark on the political landscape. Her courage to challenge the status quo, to risk personal ambition for the public good, resonated far beyond the halls of Congress. It was a demonstration of the kind of principled leadership that rekindles trust in democracy and heralds a new dawn of possibility for communities long mired in neglect. Torres, through her actions, affirmed that the true purpose of representation is to serve with relevance and resolve, even against the strongest tides of opposition.",1,2007
"In the late autumn of 1996, Judge Thomas Reed stood before a packed courtroom in the industrial heart of Cleveland, Ohio. The city, much like Minneapolis during Pamela Alexander's tenure, was struggling with the consequences of a drug epidemic that disproportionately affected its African American community. The issue at hand was not merely the fate of the individuals charged with drug offenses but the profound inequity in the sentencing guidelines for crack versus powder cocaine offenses.
Judge Reed, a man whose career was steeped in the law and who had a reputation for his judicious nature, faced a case that would not only challenge his judicial philosophy but also present him with a moral dilemma that reached far beyond the courtroom. Before him stood a young man, a first-time offender, facing a mandatory minimum sentence that seemed to Judge Reed excessively harsh and fundamentally unjust, given the nature of the offense and the defendant's background.
In a move that echoed Judge Alexander's bold stand, Judge Reed decided to take a stance against what he perceived as a deeply flawed sentencing policy. In his court, he saw the human cost of a legal system that had been blinded by the frenzy of the war on drugs—a system that routinely handed down sentences to crack cocaine defendants that were far more severe than those for powder cocaine, despite the pharmacological similarities between the two substances.
Reed, well aware of the political climate and the potential repercussions of his decision, delivered a ruling that resounded through the halls of justice. ""The scales of justice,"" he proclaimed, ""cannot balance when the weight of inequality and racism is placed on one side. It is my duty as a servant of the law to ensure that justice is blind to color and the substances that bring these young men and women before me.""
His decision to overturn the mandatory minimum sentence and instead impose a sentence that he deemed more equitable and rehabilitative sparked immediate backlash. His peers on the bench, many who adhered strictly to the sentencing guidelines, saw his actions as renegade. The local press, tapping into the national sentiment that demanded tough-on-crime policies, branded him a maverick judge who coddled criminals.
The ruling attracted the attention of the state judiciary, and Judge Reed found himself the subject of a disciplinary hearing that questioned his judicial conduct. Despite the personal and professional risks, Reed stood by his ruling, articulating his stance with the same clarity and conviction he had shown in his courtroom.
As the hearing unfolded, Reed's integrity and dedication to justice became apparent, even to his staunchest critics. The panel, in an unexpected turn, upheld his decision, recognizing the need for a critical evaluation of sentencing guidelines that had long gone unchallenged.
The fallout from his ruling did not end with the hearing. Judge Reed's aspirations for higher judicial office were undoubtedly curtailed. However, his ruling became a touchstone in the national conversation about sentencing reform, much as Judge Alexander's had nearly a decade earlier.
Years later, as the Sentencing Commission voted to address the very disparities Judge Reed had railed against, his decision in that Cleveland courtroom was vindicated. ""It's about time,"" he would later echo Judge Alexander's sentiment, as he witnessed the shift towards a more equitable justice system.
Judge Thomas Reed's stand against sentencing disparities may not have launched him into the federal judiciary, but it positioned him as a figure of courage and moral clarity. His legacy serves as a testament to the power of judicial independence and the importance of standing against the tide when the tides carry the currents of injustice.",1,2008
"In the league of capital punishment and abortion rights, the gay marriage debate ranks as one of modern America’s most incendiary political issues. Since 1969, when a police raid sparked public rioting at Manhattan’s Stonewall Inn bar, the gay-rights movement has never been absent from the national spotlight for long (Cloud, 2003). In over forty U.S. states, same-sex marriage has been outlawed or constitutionally banned (Goodstein and McKinley, 2008). Since November 2008, California has served as the main battlefield for gay-rights groups and conservative voters (McKinley, 2008). With such sensational controversies occupying the headlines, it is easy to miss a story like Nicholas D’Adamo’s.

In 2001, Nick D’Adamo would have seemed the unlikeliest of gay-rights advocates. For the past fourteen years, the Democrat had served as City Councilman for a conservative Roman Catholic neighborhood in East Baltimore (District 2, 2009). His district was home to twenty-eight churches, and he himself was a faithful Mass attendee. He had no record of promoting same-sex unions; in fact, D’Adamo had opposed a bill in 1993 to give health benefits to gay and lesbian city employees’ partners (Best Act, 2001).   

Considering this knowledge, it might seem baffling that on February 22, 2001, the same D’Adamo walked up the steps of Baltimore’s City Hall and introduced a bill to give gay partners the hospital, prison, and funeral rights enjoyed by straight couples (Ordinance, 2003). Politically speaking, it was a disastrous move. When The Baltimore Sun ran an article on the Councilman’s proposal, D’Adamo found himself bombarded by a deluge of angry phone calls. His constituents were outraged; childhood friends called to complain; D’Adamo’s own mother agonized over the shame her son had brought upon the family (Olesker, 2004).

What happened? Why would a politician place himself in the proverbial line of fire to further a cause that he had previously opposed? The day after his story broke, D’Adamo sat quietly behind his desk at City Hall. It had begun, he told the reporter there, with a number of gay constituents who had appealed to him for help. They told D’Adamo of the pain of being barred from their partners’ sickbeds or funerals by family members who could not accept that their beloved relative was gay. After hearing half a dozen such stories, D’Adamo’s formerly black-and-white view of same-sex marriage was graying. He explained: ""I look at some of these couples, and you can see on their faces the love they have for each other. And I started thinking to myself, 'Who am I to judge?'"" (Olesker, 2004).

D’Adamo’s solution was to create a city registry for same-sex partnerships that would give gay couples key hospital, prison and funeral rights (Best Act, 2001). He knew that his action would anger, disappoint or alienate his base of support. He was not seeking political advancement or praise. He was simply executing his duty as he saw fit to protect the rights of all Baltimore’s citizens. Most of the voters who had put him in office opposed his action, but D’Adamo believed that it was the right thing to do, and he did it (Best Act, 2001).

Serving the public good by disregarding public opinion may seem at odds with the American philosophy of democracy, but as President Kennedy wrote, elected officials, “must on occasion lead, inform, correct and sometimes even ignore constituent opinion, if we are to exercise fully that judgment for which we were elected” (p. 17). Sometimes, these acts of courageous independence are needed to preserve the values, precedents and liberties that define this great country. When an elected official is dictated by voters to ignore his or her own sense of justice, a valuable piece of the American representative system is lost. Americans elect representatives to serve the city, state or nation’s highest good. Popular opinion may not always point in the direction of progress and justice, and at those times it is the duty of elected officials to rely on their own judgment and conscience for guidance. In John F. Kennedy’s Profiles in Courage, a deeply independent Senator named Lucius Lamar remarked that the vote of an official who constantly pandered to popular opinion “would simply be considered as an echo of current opinion, not the result of mature deliberations” (p. 169). Councilman D’Adamo was able to rise above the fear of public condemnation, not to mention his own lifelong prejudices, to see clearly. 

D’Adamo’s act of political courage never achieved the infamy of cases like Massachusetts’s gay marriage ruling or California’s Proposition Eight. His bill sat in the city’s Judiciary and Policy Committee for nearly a year while report after report was written; then it was shuffled to the Judiciary and Legislative Investigations Committee, where it remained for another 12 months. When it became clear that the legislation would not pass, D’Adamo was forced to withdraw the bill, almost two years after he introduced  it (Ordinance, 2003). He did manage to hold his seat in City Council. D’Adamo acquired a citywide reputation for his refusal to vote the party or district lines on demand, which eventually won him a degree of trust from voters. As he described, “People might not like me, but they respect my independence” (Chalkley, 2004). He continued to serve the people of Baltimore by working to combat crime, increase police effectiveness and improve the city’s public education (Chalkley, 2004).

Yet D’Adamo’s brave attempt planted a seed in the city of Baltimore; it introduced a discussion of civil unions that had never been officially opened. That small seed finally flowered on March 17th, 2008. On that day, Baltimore’s City Council adopted a bill expressing its support of marriage licenses for gay couples in the state of Maryland (City Council Resolution, 2008). The Council’s collective statement stressed that “denial of marriage to same-sex couples is the denial of a fundamental civil right” (Council Bill, 2008).  Controversial proposals such as gay marriage rarely succeed at first attempt. It was Nicholas D’Adamo who paved the way for the new bill by taking a courageous stand for an unpopular cause. He risked his standing in the community and even his position to seek justice for a beleaguered minority. One can imagine D’Adamo’s pride on March 17th, 2008, when he beheld the resolution and voted, “Yea” (Journal, 2008, p.31).",0,2009
"West Virginia Congressman Ken Hechler paused only briefly before beginning to type. Once he began, he could not hold back the outrage he felt. As the words tumbled onto the page, the congressman’s anger poured into his “declaration of conscience.” “Coal miners don’t have to die,” he lamented. “In a civilized society, it is nothing short of criminal to allow the present conditions to continue in coal mines” (qtd. in Hume 75). Still reeling from the shock of the Farmington coal mine explosions that claimed seventy-eight lives just a few days earlier on November 20, 1968, U.S. House Representative Hechler vowed to find a way to require the coal industry to place the health and safety of miners above profit (Hechler, “Transcript”). “Coal miners have the right to live, to breathe and to be protected by twentieth-century safety standards,” he proclaimed (qtd. in Hume 75). In a bold act of political courage for a politician from a coal producing state, Representative Hechler defied coal companies and bravely led the way for passage of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969. “That explosion galvanized me, convinced me that something had to be done,” he said, even though the disaster was outside his district (qtd. in Armbrister 37).

Just as John F. Kennedy was cautioned that “the way to get along is to go along” when he entered the Senate in 1953 (Kennedy 4), politicians in West Virginia privately conceded that their survival in politics was dependent on “going along” with the interests of the dominant coal industry. In Appalachia, a complex, love-hate relationship existed with coal. Mining the deep, rich seams of black rock provided jobs for an impoverished region. Coal “wasn’t just a significant part of the economy, it WAS the economy” (“Ken Hechler: Still Green”). Yet, miners felt the industry considered “the mule . . . more important than the man” (Coal Country). Futile attempts by government to regulate coal operations were peppered with numerous loopholes making them useless (Moffat 222). By 1968, legislation mandated mine inspections, but lacked enforcement measures.

In the aftermath of Farmington, despite the pressures for conformity, Hechler openly criticized the hazardous practices of coal operators and the corruption of the United Mine Workers’ (UMW) leadership (Lewis-Beck and Alford 746). With forty-nine violations in the two years prior to the explosions, the coal executives at Farmington knew dangerous conditions existed in the doomed mine and had done nothing to improve safety (Nyden “Excerpt 1”; Armbrister 35). The UMW leadership praised the mine’s safety record and declared, “As long as we mine coal, there is always this inherent danger in explosion” (“Nyden Excerpt 2”; “Underground Revolt” 94). Hechler was infuriated by their blatant disregard for lives. Both groups were stunned when Hechler did not automatically “go along” to support them (Hume 75). “If serving in Congress means giving up to powerful interests and lying down and doing nothing, I’d prefer not to be here,” Hechler asserted (qtd. in Moffat 233-34).

Hechler moved swiftly to insist upon comprehensive reforms that included mandatory penalties for violations, stringent safety standards, and compensation for miners disabled by black lung (“Too Late for 78” 36). He felt the UMW shortchanged miner health and safety (Moffat 210) and had a “private conspiracy with [coal] management which [had] resulted in . . . high accident rates, high levels of coal dust and high incidences of black lung” (“Mine Safety” 278). On January 26, 1969, Hechler prominently displayed a twelve-pound chunk of bologna to a crowd of miners as his description of the UMW’s position on miner health and safety (Armbrister 50; Hume 83). In response, the UMW called him “a monkey searching for a flea,” (Moffat 216) “a jackass . . . making braying noises at one end and unrestrained noises from the other” (218) “ a fink,” “spy,” “stool pigeon,” (Hume 84) and compared him to Joe McCarthy (86); much of which was promptly published in the UMW Journal (84).

Hechler received letters from irate coal executives and miners within his district withdrawing their support for him. Colleagues from his state delegation rushed to the industry’s defense while ridiculing and belittling Hechler (Hume 87-88; Moffat 216-17; Ken Hechler: In Pursuit of Justice). A group of fifty miners came to his Washington office to harass him (Hume 219). FBI records revealed that murderer Paul Gilly, hired by the UMW, had attempted to kill Hechler, but a crooked mountain road had “prevented his getting a bead” on him (Moffat 221). Refusing to be intimidated, Hechler observed, “I don’t have as many friends as I use to. I was meek and quiet for a long time, but you have to choose at some point if you want to be a good, popular guy or be an S.O.B. to accomplish something” (qtd. in Moffat 223).

By February 6, 1969, Hechler had drafted and introduced a new mining bill (Armbrister 50) declaring “the first priority of all in the coal and mine industry must be the health and safety of its most precious resource – the miner” (U.S. Congress). Hechler’s primary focus was to ensure passage of an effective bill (Moffat 223). He hired an attorney to monitor committee deliberations (Hume 160). To avoid compromise, Hechler purposefully remained off of the committees reviewing the legislation (Moffat 222). Instead, he maneuvered to add nine amendments to the bill when it was debated in the House (Armbrister 137). When President Nixon indicated he would veto the act, Hechler invited the Farmington widows to Washington at his personal expense to press for passage of the measure (Ken Hechler: In Pursuit of Justice, “Coal Mining”). Nixon relented and quietly signed the Act into law on December 30, 1969 (Armbrister 165; Moffat 223).

The Mine Safety & Health Administration praises the law as “the strongest and most comprehensive occupational safety and health protections that had ever been enacted in the U.S.” (Main). Hechler’s courageous refusal to “go along” with coal’s special interests led to sweeping reforms that saved thousands of lives. Believing that government is responsible for restraining those practices that exploit the public (Hechler, Congressional Digest 140), Hechler continued with stalwart courage to oppose corruption, strip mining and mountaintop removal practices. After being arrested at the age of ninety-four for protesting against mountaintop removal mining, Hechler did not hesitate as he typed a new declaration. “I used to be an agitator,” he began,” then an activist. Now I am a hell-raiser” (qtd. in Biggers). In Profiles in Courage, Kennedy affirmed that, “Each man must decide for himself the course he will follow” (225). Ken Hechler has courageously done just that.  ",0,2010
"Amidst the clamor of political debates that often split the American public—abortion rights, capital punishment, and more recently, the contentious issue of gay marriage—stand legislators who choose principle over popularity, often at great personal and political cost. This narrative was embodied by Councilman James Patrick of Midland City, Arizona, a staunchly conservative district with deeply rooted family values.
It was a blistering summer afternoon in 2003 when Councilman Patrick, a lifelong resident of Midland City and a man of deep religious conviction, introduced a civil union ordinance designed to extend certain legal protections to same-sex couples—hospital visitation rights, the right to make medical decisions, and fair treatment in housing and employment.
For Patrick, who had spent the majority of his political career championing issues far from the realm of LGBTQ+ rights, this was an unexpected pivot. His district, characterized by its traditional views and strong church attendance, had never seen him as anything but a reflection of their conservative ideals.
Yet, it was the harrowing account of a young man from his district—a man denied the chance to say goodbye to his dying partner—that shifted Councilman Patrick's perspective. As he put it, ""The moment you witness such profound grief denied recognition and dignity, the world changes color. The lines we draw in the sand between us, they blur, and you're compelled to ask yourself—who are we to deny compassion?""
The backlash was immediate. Patrick faced not only the ire of his constituents, who flooded his office with calls of betrayal, but also the cold shoulders of political allies who had walked beside him for decades. His pastor, once a close confidant, questioned his faith. Friends from his youth expressed their dismay publicly, and even his family felt the sting of community ostracism.
But Councilman Patrick, much like Nicholas D'Adamo before him, was steadfast. ""There are moments,"" he stated, ""when what's demanded of us as representatives of the people is to guide, not just follow. To shine a light on paths less trodden if it leads to greater justice.""
Patrick's civil union ordinance was seen as political harakiri. The editorial columns labeled him an opportunist, a fallen conservative, or at best, a misguided soul. In council meetings, he sat resolute as the proposal faced critique and condemnation.
As anticipated, the ordinance stalled, languishing in committee discussions and facing eventual withdrawal. Yet, the dialogue had changed in Midland City. The issue of same-sex unions was no longer an abstract concept but a community matter, a question of basic human rights that now had a face and a voice.
Councilman Patrick, whose political prospects dimmed in the wake of his stance, found solace in the fact that his actions had ignited a broader conversation. He may have lost his seat in the following election, but he gained something perhaps more enduring—a sense of having extended the boundaries of empathy and fairness in his corner of the world.
The legacy of Councilman James Patrick's daring stand became fully apparent in the spring of 2006. On a wave of changing attitudes, Midland City passed a resolution in support of same-sex civil unions, recognizing the dignity and rights of all its citizens, regardless of who they loved.
In the quiet pride of Councilman Patrick's heart, as he witnessed the passing of the resolution he had once championed, lay the affirmation that true courage in public service is not measured in electoral victories, but in the advancement of justice and equality for all.",1,2009
"In a time where political expediency often trumps integrity, the audacious stand of Congressman Matthew Gibson on behalf of coal miners in the rugged landscape of Eastern Kentucky stands as a testament to conviction over capitulation. Gibson, a native son of Kentucky and a man deeply rooted in the bluegrass and the hardships of Appalachian life, found himself at the crossroads of political allegiance and the welfare of the very people he was elected to serve.
The year was 1976, and the coal industry in Kentucky was booming, an economic juggernaut that provided sustenance to a region otherwise marked by economic woes. Gibson, whose family had been entwined with the coal seams of the mountains for generations, knew well the toll that mining took on the men and women who delved into the earth.
The catalyst for Gibson's stand was a series of devastating mining accidents in his district, culminating in a tragic explosion that claimed the lives of 38 miners. The incident shook the core of every mining family and laid bare the egregious safety oversights and regulatory gaps that had long been part of an unspoken understanding in the industry.
Gibson, spurred by the tragedy and the outpouring of grief from his constituents, chose to challenge the coal companies and advocate for sweeping reforms. He introduced legislation mandating stricter safety regulations, unyielding enforcement of mining protocols, and harsh penalties for violations that endangered miners' lives.
In taking on the coal industry, Gibson was well aware of the potential backlash. The industry had deep pockets and wielded considerable influence in the political arena of Kentucky. Gibson's phone rang incessantly with calls from company executives issuing thinly-veiled threats about his political future. Coal lobbyists besieged his office, and the local media, often supported by coal advertising dollars, questioned his judgment.
Like Congressman Ken Hechler before him, Gibson's resolve was subjected to the trial by fire. In the hallowed halls of Congress, he faced the ire of his own delegation, many of whom saw his actions as a betrayal of Kentucky's economic lifeline. Even more personally, at the local diner where he was once greeted with warm handshakes, whispers followed him—a mix of gratitude from miners' families and scorn from those swayed by the coal companies' narrative.
Undeterred, Gibson pursued his campaign with a blend of ardor and strategy, often invoking the memory of those who had perished in the mines to rally support for his cause. His impassioned speeches on the floor of the House, where he called for a commitment to the human lives behind the coal industry's profit margins, garnered national attention.
Gibson's bill, much like Hechler's, faced a tortuous path through committees and subcommittees, but in the end, it triumphed. The new law brought about a sea change in mine safety, dramatically reducing the number of accidents and fatalities. It was a victory not just for Gibson but for every miner who had ever donned a hard hat in the pursuit of the coal that powered a nation.
Congressman Matthew Gibson's political career may have suffered—his subsequent reelection campaign was fraught with challenges, and he narrowly retained his seat. Yet, in the twilight of his public service, Gibson could look back on a legacy that valued the lives and safety of his fellow Kentuckians above political gain—a legacy that underscored the very essence of courageous leadership lauded by Kennedy in Profiles in Courage.
As Gibson reflected on his journey, much like Hechler, he took pride not in the accolades or the victories but in the simple, profound knowledge that his actions had affirmed the worth of every man and woman who braved the depths of the earth for the prosperity of all.",1,2010
"Throughout the Florida Capitol building, there are portraits or memorials commemorating virtually every political dignitary of the state’s past, including a caretaker governor who served merely three days. Nowhere on the premises, however, is there a tribute to the man who committed the most laudable act of political courage in Florida’s history. That man is the late John B. Orr Jr. of Miami (Dyckman).
In response to the Supreme Court’s landmark 1954 Brown v. Board of Education ruling, Florida was one of many Southern states that attempted to forestall racial integration of its public school system. Amidst the 1956 gubernatorial elections, incumbent Florida Governor LeRoy Collins “quietly supported a committee to explore legal measures by which the state could fortify its system of segregated practices” (Winsboro). The committee, chaired by retired Circuit Judge L.L. Fabisinski of Pensacola, recommended “the strengthening of local school boards and the enhancement of the governor’s powers of law enforcement” in order to perpetuate segregation of Florida’s educational institutions (Winsboro). Bearing in mind the Fabisinski Commission’s analysis, Governor Collins drafted a package of bills, including a Pupil Assignment Act and a Private School Corporation Act, to circumvent the Supreme Court’s Brown ruling.
On July 26, 1956, Governor Collins proposed the Fabisinski Commission segregation bills during a special session of the state legislature. When the roll was called on the first of the bills to reach the House floor, eighty-nine legislators, embracing Florida’s discriminatory racial customs, voted ‘Aye.’ Representative John B. Orr Jr. alone voted ‘Nay’ (“Southerner”). On a point of personal privilege, Orr addressed a hushed and tense chamber to justify his dissent (“Dade”). “I believe that segregation is morally wrong,” he professed. “I believe that second- class citizens are repugnant to democratic principles. The fact that the custom is of long standing makes it no less wrong” (“Southerner”). Orr probed the roots of Florida’s racial intolerance, asserting that “the pigmentation of one’s skin is no rational basis for setting him apart,” and, alluding to the original text of the Fifteenth Amendment, “we are backed by our constitution, that we do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, or creed” (“Dade”).
In addition to his ethical grievances, Orr censured his colleagues’ flagrant disrespect for the Supreme Court’s Brown ruling and the broader principles of American law. “To defy the highest court in our land,” Orr introspected, “is unthinkable to me” (“Southerner”). Echoing the Warren Court’s unanimous opinion in Brown, Orr noted that Florida had “not provided equal but separate educational facilities and I don’t believe this is possible. As a consequence of the disparity in educational facilities, we in the South have had over the years a large segment of our population which has been poorly educated” (“Orr’s”). Orr’s subsequent revelation that he was a member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) garnered perhaps the bitterest revulsion from his fellow legislators (“NAACP”). The lone dissenter concluded his speech by quoting a prayer recited by the chaplain of the House two days before: “Help us, thus, to see that it is better to fail in a just cause that will ultimately succeed, than to succeed in an unrighteous cause that will ultimately fail” (Taylor). Galvanized by the injustices of Florida’s segregation tradition, Orr boldly advocated for equal academic facilities for an oppressed African-American minority.
Just as John F. Kennedy admired the maverick independence of eight U.S. senators in Profiles in Courage, State Representative Orr epitomized “a politician conscientiously desiring…‘to push [his] skiff from the shore alone’ into a hostile and turbulent sea” (Kennedy 3). After his twenty minute tirade against the Fabisinski bills, Orr “received no applause” when he returned to his House seat (Boyles). Such silence was only a ripple in the torrential political and personal backlash Orr faced in the wake of his lone dissent. The following morning, Orr’s aunt received a phone call threatening death upon Orr and his family (“Orr’s”). A mob of white supremacists bearing torches trespassed onto Orr’s property and burned a cross into his front lawn with gasoline (Duke). In evaluating Orr’s pro-integration stand, Florida newspapers lamented that the young Miamian was “washed up politically” and “alone – without friends – among his fellow legislators” (McDermott, “Stand”). The Miami Herald queried:
Would it not have been better for Orr to have ‘taken a walk’ at the time of the voting in the House of Representatives rather than develop increased animosity of the smaller counties against big Dade? Absenting one’s self from a roll call vote may not be the bravest thing to do, but it is an old maneuver used by politicians who do not wish to be recorded voting on a particular issue. (“Stand”)
Orr could have “taken a walk” during this grueling trial of conscience. But he didn’t.
Miami-Dade voters responded no more favorably to Orr’s audacious dissent. The young legislator was re-elected in 1956 only because the filing deadline had passed (Dyckman). Two years later, “when the opposition had time to gird itself for the battle,” Orr lost to segregationist David Eldridge in the Democratic primary election (Dean). Like outspoken Missouri Senator Thomas Hart Benton, featured in Kennedy’s Profiles in Courage, State Representative Orr was “willing to meet crushing defeat rather than compromise his principles” because “his desire to win or maintain a reputation for integrity and courage was stronger than his desire to maintain his office” (Kennedy 88, 218). Although Orr never achieved any political office higher than Miami-Dade County mayor, a part-time position with little influence, he continued to press for the gradual integration of Florida’s school system (Dyckman, Vecchione).
Orr’s political martyrdom sowed a seed for educational reform in Florida. That seed finally germinated on the morning of September 7, 1959, when “twenty-five African-American students stepped onto the grounds of Orchard Villa Elementary School and Air Base Elementary School,” marking the official end of segregation within the Miami-Dade County Public School system (Winsboro). In essence, Titles IV and VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 enabled federal enforcement of desegregation in Florida’s remaining insubordinate school districts (Winsboro). After years of stalwart advocacy in the face of overwhelming opposition, Orr witnessed his just cause of racial integration ultimately succeed.",0,2011
"In the midst of the civil rights turmoil that shook the United States, a courageous stand by a single state senator in Alabama became a beacon of hope for change amidst the storm. Senator William J. Bryan of Montgomery, known for his quiet demeanor and conservative voting record, found himself in a maelstrom of controversy when faced with a decision that would not only test his political alliances but also his personal convictions.
It was the spring of 1965 when the Alabama State Senate found itself debating a set of education bills that were, in essence, a thinly veiled attempt to circumvent the recent desegregation mandates set forth by the Supreme Court. In a state where segregation was deeply embedded in the fabric of society, these bills were expected to pass without significant opposition.
Senator Bryan, however, experienced a crisis of conscience. With a legal background and a deep-seated belief in the principles of the Constitution, Bryan could not reconcile the proposed legislation with the equal protection guaranteed under the law. Despite counsel from colleagues to maintain the status quo and not rock the boat, Bryan’s conviction led him to a different path.
In a session that would become historical, Bryan rose from his seat to address the chamber. His voice, usually reserved for mundane legislative exchanges, now carried a weight of urgency. ""The eyes of the nation are upon us,"" he declared, ""and we must decide whether to uphold the laws of the land or to succumb to the tides of convenience and injustice.""
The backlash was immediate and severe. Senator Bryan faced not only the ire of his fellow legislators but also the censure of his constituents. His office received a flood of angry calls, and his family was ostracized in social circles that once welcomed them. The Alabama press, which had long ignored Bryan’s moderate contributions, now branded him a traitor to Southern heritage.
Much like John B. Orr Jr. of Florida, Senator Bryan's career was on the line. Yet, in the tradition of those honored in Kennedy's Profiles in Courage, Bryan remained undeterred. He had cast his vote against the bills, firmly and without regret, understanding that his political career in Alabama's state politics was likely over.
The education bills, despite Bryan’s opposition, passed in the Senate but not without raising public awareness about the injustice and prompting a reevaluation of the issue among some of his colleagues. Bryan’s act of defiance did not immediately change the laws, but it planted the seeds of change in the hearts and minds of many.
The 1966 election saw Senator Bryan lose his seat, but his solitary vote against segregation stood as a testament to his integrity. He left office with his head held high, knowing that he had stayed true to the ideals of equality and justice, even in the face of overwhelming opposition.
Years later, as the winds of change swept through the South and schools began to desegregate, William J. Bryan’s stand was vindicated. His once-controversial vote was now seen as a prescient act of courage by a public servant who valued principle above politics. Though his political career was cut short, his legacy endured, illustrating the power of individual conviction in the pursuit of a just cause.",1,2011
"Beside the Christina River in downtown Wilmington stands a bronze statue of Delaware’s former governor Russell Peterson, looking resolutely over a park named in his honor. What could Peterson, a one-term governor of America’s second-smallest state, possibly have accomplished to deserve this monument? Nothing less than enacting perhaps our nation’s most underappreciated conservation law, the 1971 Coastal Zone Act, which has saved Delaware from the industrial blight that plagues other points on America’s East Coast (Kristl 37-8). As he battled to pass this law, Peterson, in the words of President Kennedy, “showed the real meaning of courage and a real faith in democracy” (18).
When Peterson took office in 1969, Delaware’s coastline and namesake Bay were being targeted for overwhelming industrial development. For several years, Shell Oil had been quietly preparing to build a $200 million refinery adjacent to Bombay Hook National Wildlife Refuge (“Delaware Bars Heavy Industry From Coastline”; Smith 3). Meanwhile, Zapata-Norness Inc., a shipping firm founded by George H.W. Bush, was planning to construct a 300-acre island in Delaware’s territorial waters on which to store mountains of coal and iron ore (Smith 3). Still another group, a consortium of oil companies, envisioned a massive offshore supertanker terminal (Peterson, Rebel 133). The Nixon administration eagerly supported these facilities, which promised to establish Delaware as a global industrial center—with the unfortunate side effect of devastating the state’s coastal environment (Williams 213-214).
Many governors would have welcomed such sweeping development, including one of Peterson’s predecessors, Caleb Boggs, who in the 1950’s had overseen construction of a heavily polluting refinery at Delaware City (“Delaware Governors”; Williams 191). Industrial leaders believed that Peterson, a Republican and former DuPont executive, would surely support further industrialization (Williams 214). Yet Kennedy’s belief that a politician “must judge…which step will most help or hinder the ideals to which he is committed” (11) rang true for Peterson, who, through his family pastime of birding, had “come to see what a good thing we had in southern Delaware—a relatively unspoiled paradise” (Peterson, Rebel 125). This appreciation for nature led Peterson to conclude, despite Boggs’ strong precedent and his own corporate past, that rampant industrialization was not in Delaware’s best interests. Rather than accept this trend as inevitable, however, he began crafting a plan for the coast’s protection (Peterson, Rebel 128-9).
In January 1971, upon this plan’s completion, Peterson boldly addressed the General Assembly, vowed that he would not allow industrial development “if the price is disfigurement and pollution of our environment”(qtd. in Williams 214), and called for passage of a Coastal Zone Act (CZA). This bill took the nationally unprecedented step of declaring Delaware’s coastline and waters forever off-limits to new heavy industrial development (Kristl 4; Coastal Zone Act). Not surprisingly, it soon drew the ire of what Kennedy termed, “the articulate few whose views cannot be ignored” (10).
Peterson courageously defied this opposition as he steered the bill through the legislative process. His first test came within weeks of announcing his intentions, when the State Chamber of Commerce, representing all of Delaware’s major corporations, voted unanimously to oppose Peterson’s vision, accusing him of “extreme discrimination” against heavy industry (qtd. in Peterson, Rebel 134). Peterson could have ended this animosity by withdrawing his support for the CZA, yet he explained to the Chamber’s President that doing so “would be discrimination against the people of Delaware. I have been elected to represent their interests to the best of my abilities” (Peterson, Rebel 134). This devotion to his constituents echoed that of Senator George Norris in Profiles in Courage, who explained that he took deeply unpopular positions, “to do what in my heart I believed to be right for the people at large” (qtd. in Kennedy 182).
Peterson mirrored Norris’ tenacity throughout the spring of 1971 as he shielded the CZA from a broad array of attacks. The Governor refused to be swayed when construction workers who had anticipated employment by the oil companies picketed outside his home, or when the president of Shell personally visited him in an attempt to soften his stance (Peterson, Rebel 136- 8). Secretary of Commerce Maurice Stans took a much harder line when he summoned Peterson to Washington, looked the Governor straight in the eye, and said, “We think you are being disloyal to our country.” A lesser man would have crumbled under such a harsh rebuke, but Peterson simply replied, “Hell, no. I am being loyal to future generations of Americans” (qtd. in Peterson, Rebel 145).
Thanks to this resolve, the bill never deviated from its strict ban on all forms of heavy industry on Delaware’s coastline, despite oil companies’ vicious attempts to weaken the bill or block it altogether (Williams 216). Finally, late on the nights of June 21st and 22nd, the CZA was narrowly passed by the state legislature and triumphantly signed into law by Governor Peterson (Peterson, “History”). A New York Times editorial underscored this achievement’s significance:
It is almost inconceivable that ten, even five years ago the Governor and legislature of any state would have barred heavy industry from its coastal lands…forty-nine other states, including New York, can learn something from the exceptionally perceptive action of Governor Peterson (“Delaware Shows the Way”).
This sentiment reverberated across America as New York, California, Massachusetts, and several other states enacted conservation measures inspired by the CZA, preserving countless acres in their natural beauty (Peterson, Rebel 177-78).
After sparking this trend of conservation, Peterson made yet another “perceptive action,” one which proved to be his undoing. Mere hours after signing the CZA, Peterson candidly informed the state legislature that tax hikes would be necessary to rescue Delaware’s finances. This straightforward act crippled Peterson’s bid for re-election, ending his political career (Cohen). Yet Peterson’s defeat was far outweighed by the national legacy of his Coastal Zone Act, which confirms Kennedy’s belief that the work of courageous politicians “has reached the homes and enriched the heritage of every citizen in every part of the land” (Kennedy 19).
Nowhere is this legacy more apparent than in Delaware itself. Where there could have been miles of pipelines, supertanker ports, and an ever-present risk of catastrophic spills, the CZA ensured that there are instead clean waters, pristine wetlands, and excellent beaches that continue to support lucrative fishing and tourism industries (Kristl 103). Peterson best summarized the rewards of his courageous action when he reflected, nearly four decades after the law’s signing, that, “Our choice was to cherish or destroy. We decided to cherish” (Peterson, “History”).",0,2012
"In a time of pervasive environmental neglect, Governor Thomas E. Sheridan of Rhode Island emerged as an unlikely champion of conservation, spearheading the passage of the groundbreaking 1978 Rhode Island Coastal Preservation Act. His audacious campaign to protect the state's vulnerable coastlines echoed a similar fight waged by Delaware's Governor Russell Peterson years earlier.
Governor Sheridan, a pragmatic leader with a background in manufacturing and no prior record as an environmentalist, was confronted with a choice that would define his tenure and legacy. Rhode Island, with its extensive shoreline, had become the target for industrial development that threatened to mar its scenic beaches and vital marine ecosystems.
The catalyst for Sheridan's crusade was a proposed industrial complex in Narragansett Bay. The project promised economic growth but at the cost of the ecological integrity of Rhode Island's shores. As plans progressed, a small contingent of environmental activists and concerned citizens rallied against the development, calling on Sheridan to intervene.
Initially, the political and economic pressures to greenlight the project were immense. Industrial leaders, lobbyists, and even labor unions argued that the governor's support was crucial for job creation and economic stability. Yet, the words of President Kennedy resonated with Sheridan, who believed that a politician must sometimes ""show the real meaning of courage and a real faith in democracy"" (Kennedy 18).
Sheridan took a principled stand, announcing his opposition to the industrialization of the coast. His commitment to safeguarding Rhode Island's environment led to the drafting of the Coastal Preservation Act, which sought to impose strict regulations on coastal development and establish protected areas along the shoreline.
The governor's stance was met with a torrent of criticism. He faced a formidable coalition of opponents, including some within his own party. His political career was jeopardized as prominent donors threatened to withdraw support, and local newspapers questioned his judgment. Still, Sheridan, like Peterson, remained steadfast in his convictions.
Despite the escalating pressure, Sheridan deployed a blend of political acumen and personal conviction to navigate the Act through a skeptical legislature. His unwavering dedication to the cause, much like Peterson's, was encapsulated in marathon legislative sessions and impassioned public addresses wherein he argued that ""the very identity of our state is intertwined with the health of our coasts.""
Governor Sheridan's courage came at a personal cost. Though the Coastal Preservation Act eventually passed, the political capital expended left him vulnerable. His subsequent reelection bid was met with fierce opposition, and he narrowly retained his office.
Yet, the passage of the Act marked a pivotal moment for environmental conservation in Rhode Island. Sheridan's bold leadership catalyzed a shift in public consciousness, fostering a broader recognition of the need to balance economic development with environmental stewardship.
The years following saw Sheridan's once controversial act lauded as visionary. As Rhode Island's coastlines remained unspoiled, the state became a haven for tourists and a refuge for diverse marine life. Sheridan's legacy, much like Peterson's, transcended the ephemeral nature of political office, securing a cherished natural heritage for future generations.
Reflecting on his journey, Governor Thomas E. Sheridan was content in the knowledge that his courageous stand had not only preserved the ecological treasures of Rhode Island but had also instilled an enduring ethos of environmental respect within its people. His statue, overlooking the Providence River, stands not merely as a tribute to the man but as a symbol of the indomitable spirit of conservation he embodied.",1,2012
"Under the bright lights of Russell Sage College in Troy, New York, only a few days before the September 2012 Republican primary, State Senator Roy McDonald was clearly exasperated. Despite his attempts to focus the debate on chronic unemployment, his opponent Kathleen A. Marchione had another agenda. Over the roar of the restless crowd, Marchione persistently questioned McDonald about his controversial vote in favor of the Marriage Equality Act in June 2011. In rebuttal to Marchione’s accusations that his vote to legalize same-sex marriage was motivated by the promise of campaign donations, McDonald explained that he broke from traditional Republican values because he was a “human being that care[d]” and “could have found an easier way to get re-elected” (Kaplan, “Gay Marriage Vote”). In what New York Governor Andrew M. Cuomo described as “an act of political courage,” McDonald crossed party lines in June 2011 to set the precedent of marriage equality in New York State (Kaplan and Grynbaum).
McDonald’s vote in favor of same-sex marriage shocked his constituents. Known for his conservative values, McDonald was a well-respected Republican from Saratoga County. During his 23-year run as the Town and County Supervisor and the chairman of the Saratoga County Board of Supervisors, McDonald’s proudest achievement was eliminating local property taxes for 20 consecutive years. In fact, the county budget he proposed made Saratoga the lowest taxed county in New York State. After building a reputation of reliability and traditionalism in Saratoga, McDonald moved on to state politics with his election to the state senate in 2008 (“Roy”). As John F. Kennedy asserts in Profiles in Courage, one’s courageous potential is “an opportunity that sooner or later is presented to us all” (Kennedy 225). The Marriage Equality Act presented McDonald the opportunity to elevate himself from a forgettable official to a bold nonconformist.
McDonald’s role in the passage of the Marriage Equality Act was groundbreaking. The New York State legislature was the first chamber with a Republican majority to approve same-sex marriage (Kaplan, “Results for G.O.P.”). McDonald was one of only four Republican senators who voted for the Marriage Equality Act, making New York the sixth state to allow same-sex marriage. Affecting more than 42,000 same-sex couples raising 14,000 children, the law provided that same-sex couples could obtain marriage licenses and acquire the rights, benefits, and protections of married couples (“Know”). Gay-rights advocates rejoiced the passage of the act, including Governor Cuomo who applauded McDonald for standing up “for equality, and for a population long victimized” (Kaplan, “Cuomo Backs Republican”). Although the 777,000 same-sex couples living in the United States and other gay-rights supporters celebrated the first Republican-leaning state to sanction same-sex marriage, the opponents of the act were outraged (Nagle 5).
The backlash against McDonald and other supporters of the Marriage Equality Act began on July 25, 2011, with the first legal challenge to the new law. Leaders of New Yorkers for Constitutional Freedoms, an evangelical church group, asked the courts to halt same-sex marriage ceremonies and declare the hundreds of same-sex marriages performed since the law took effect to be void. The conservative group claimed that the Senate Republicans, including McDonald, engaged in illegal meetings with New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Governor Cuomo in which the Senators received donations for switching to support the law (Precious). Despite the rising pressure from conservative groups, McDonald said that he would not regret his vote even if it ended his political career (Kaplan, “Gay Marriage Vote”). He maintained the “faith that his course was the best one” and thus defended his political courage (Kennedy 219).
In addition to specific conservative groups like the New Yorkers for Constitutional Freedoms, the majority of the American public is opposed to same-sex marriage. According to a survey conducted in 2003 by the Pew Research Center for the People of the Press, 59 percent of Americans oppose allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally (“Public”). In a 2004 National Election Studies survey, 75 percent of respondents agreed that there should be more emphasis on traditional family ties and religious values (Rimmerman and Wilcox 221). Overall, Republicans identify with the traditional and biblical definition of marriage more than Democrats. In fact, only 23 percent of Republicans supported legalizing gay marriage in a 2012 CNN/ORC International poll (Reinhard). Therefore, the condemnation of McDonald’s vote on the Marriage Equality Act among his Republican constituents could have been expected; McDonald cast his vote knowing the threat it posed to his political career.
McDonald learned the true consequence of his vote on September 13, 2012, when his opponent Marchione defeated him in the Republican primary by approximately 122 votes (Kaplan, “Votes Aren’t All Tallied”). Marchione credited her victory to the fact that “people fe[lt] betrayed” by McDonald’s endorsement of the Marriage Equality Act. She and her supporters accused McDonald of deceiving his constituents by changing his position on same-sex marriage, which he had opposed in the past. However, McDonald explained that he too believes in traditional marriage and was not looking for his “15 minutes of fame” by casting the controversial vote. Rather, he was protecting his “party of Abraham Lincoln,” in which “everybody’s included” (Kaplan, “Gay Marriage Vote”). In the words of Kennedy, McDonald was more than a “robot dutifully recording the views of constituents” or a “time- server skilled only in predicting and following the tides of public sentiment” (Kennedy 18). He switched his position on same-sex marriage to protect the equality and dignity of the greater public; for this act, his reputation among his conservative constituents was irreversibly damaged.
McDonald’s leap of faith in June 2011 came at a steep price. Although his vote in favor of same-sex marriage cost him his reelection to the state senate, it was a worthy sacrifice. In the words of Mayor Bloomberg, McDonald walked away from the state senate with the “satisfaction of knowing for the rest of [his] life [he] stood up and voted [his] conscience” (Kaplan and Grynbaum). McDonald reaffirmed America’s “faith that the people will not simply elect men who will represent their views ably and faithfully, but also elect men who will exercise their conscientious judgment” (Kennedy 223). During his first and last term in the state senate, McDonald achieved a feat most politicians do not accomplish in a lifetime—he embodied true democracy.",0,2013
"In the tense atmosphere of a town hall in a conservative district, with the crucial midterm elections looming, Representative Jane Smith faced an increasingly agitated audience. Her recent vote in favor of comprehensive climate change legislation, diverging sharply from her party's typical stance, was the hot topic. Amidst fervent discussions on economic policies and healthcare, her challenger, Mike Johnson, steered the debate towards Smith's environmental vote. He suggested her decision was swayed by influential environmental groups' endorsements. Smith, visibly frustrated but composed, countered that her vote was rooted in a deep concern for future generations and environmental sustainability, stating, ""I voted as a concerned citizen, aware of our planet's fragility. I could have taken the easy route for re-election.""
Smith's unexpected support for the climate change bill had taken her constituents by surprise. Known for her pragmatic approach and strong advocacy for fiscal responsibility, Smith had earned respect across her district. Her notable achievements included significant improvements in local infrastructure and education, winning her broad support. Transitioning from local to national politics with her election to Congress, she had always prioritized her constituents' immediate needs.
However, Smith's decision to back the climate change legislation marked a pivotal moment, reminiscent of historical instances where politicians took bold steps for the greater good, often cited in discussions about political courage. The legislation, while controversial, aimed to set ambitious targets for reducing carbon emissions, with far-reaching implications for both the environment and the economy.
The backlash was swift. A vocal segment of Smith's base felt betrayed, having expected her to uphold traditional party values. Critics argued that the legislation would burden businesses and lead to job losses, a point Johnson hammered on during their debates.
Legal challenges to the bill emerged almost immediately, spearheaded by groups arguing it would harm the economy. Yet, despite the mounting pressure, Smith remained steadfast, believing in the long-term benefits of her decision, even if it jeopardized her political career.
Public opinion on climate change and environmental policies was divided. While a significant portion of the public recognized the urgency of addressing climate change, others remained skeptical, often aligning along partisan lines. This division was reflected in Smith's district, where her stance on the bill was both lauded and criticized.
The true test came on election day. Smith's re-election bid was narrowly defeated by Johnson, who capitalized on the discontent with her climate change vote. Johnson's campaign had painted Smith as out of touch with her constituents, a narrative that resonated with voters who felt alienated by her decision.
In defeat, Smith remained dignified, expressing no regrets about her stance. She believed in the importance of inclusive leadership and the responsibility of elected officials to make decisions for the common good, even at personal or political cost. Her vote on the climate change bill, though controversial, was a testament to her commitment to principle over politics, echoing the sentiment that true democracy involves electing representatives who not only reflect the public's views but also exercise their judgment for the greater good.",1,2013
"Colorado State Senate President John Morse was not your typical arm’s-length, politically calculating legislator when it came to the issue of gun control. As an ex- policeman and paramedic, a man who personally had dealt with armed criminals, been shot at, and helped save the lives of shooting victims in the past (Dionne), he had a deeply personal connection with the topic, a perspective that endowed him with a unique resolve to fight for the safety of Colorado citizens. But following his gut and doing what he felt was best for his constituents, ironically, turned out not to be what his constituents demanded of him. Morse’s ardent support of five gun-control bills—including HB 1224, probably the most controversial of them (Stokols)—eventually led to Morse’s and fellow Senator Angela Giron’s recall, making the two politicians the first in Colorado’s history to be unseated in special elections (Healy).
Morse was at the forefront of the successful effort in Colorado to pass sweeping legislation that tightened gun regulations and implemented extended background checks (Ferner, “John Morse, Colo.”) in the wake of the Newtown, Connecticut shootings of 2012. For his efforts, he was pursued vehemently by pro-gun activists and organizations (Millhiser). Morse persistently fought for his beliefs despite knowing the political risk he was taking in the purple state of Colorado, where voters are sharply divided on the issue (“Colorado Voters”). With “no regrets” (qtd. in Ferner, “State Sen.”), Morse did what he felt would be best for his state, martyring his Senate office for it and proving himself “courageous in [his] unyielding devotion to absolute principles,” as John F. Kennedy wrote in Profiles in Courage (Kennedy 19).
As a state senator in the very state where both the Columbine shooting tragedy of 1999 and the Aurora movie theater shooting of 2012 occurred, perhaps John Morse felt he had a greater responsibility than his Democratic colleagues across the nation to do something big. He pushed for passage of bills that, in a summary written by Morse himself for Newsweek, required 15 bullets to be the maximum per magazine, put in place mandatory background checks paid by gun buyers, allowed state judges control over firearms in the possession of domestic violence offenders, and prevented self-concealed gun permits from being obtained online (Morse). These regulations were anathema to many of his constituents: a Quinnipiac poll showed that 39% of independent voters and a mere 7% of Colorado Republicans supported these new gun bills, with a majority of Coloradans in opposition (“Colorado Voters”). In El Paso County, which encompasses the entirety of Morse’s district, large majorities voted for Mitt Romney and other Republicans (“El Paso County”), and unaffiliated voters make up a majority in the region (Lee), so Morse knew he didn’t have a Democratic base he could rely upon if he took huge political risks. Morse noted the opposition but held firm, saying before the recall vote, “Keeping Coloradans safe from gun violence is very worth your political career” (qtd. in Millhiser).
In addition to the majority of Republicans opposing gun control legislation, the National Rifle Association (NRA) has long been a zealous adversary of firearm reform efforts, earning a reputation for being the most effective interest group in American government, according to Fortune’s “Power 25” list featured by Schmidt, Shelley, Bardes, and Ford (250). The NRA also has a record of trouncing incumbents (Miller). Sure enough, the NRA and other gun advocacy groups launched a myriad of advertisements aimed at degrading and shaming Senator Morse (Rakich). One television ad asserted Morse’s proposals would leave the community with less freedom, and that “Morse voted for more taxes” (NRA Morse Recall). In actuality, the laws Morse supported enabled Coloradans to pay fewer taxes, with gun purchasers themselves paying what taxpayers otherwise would have (Morse).
John Morse did not “vote in platoons, joining whomever of [his] colleagues [were] equally enslaved in some current fashion.” Rather, he exercised the “independent judgment” that Kennedy called key to a democracy, the self-determining thoughts that “can enable us to surpass that foreign ideology that fears free thought more than it fears hydrogen bombs” (Kennedy 18). John Morse lost his job with fewer than 11% of registered El Paso residents voting to recall him (Weber), in a special election prompted by the state senator’s expression of his ability to think freely and autonomously, not as a meager “seismograph,” only “recording shifts in popular opinion” (Kennedy 15).
Morse told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow that he and his caucus—inspired by Abraham Lincoln’s example—were taking note of public opinion, but no longer reading the thousands of pro-gun emails they received (The Rachel Maddow Show). Critics berated him, complaining that Morse wasn’t listening to the people who put him in office. What those behind this backlash didn’t realize was that Morse’s comment was in complete harmony with an idea at the heart of Profiles in Courage. Kennedy wrote that because politicians were selected to make rational decisions based on voters’ and the nation’s welfare, politicians “must on occasion lead, inform, correct, and sometimes even ignore constituent opinion, if [they] are to exercise fully that judgment for which [they] are elected” (Kennedy 15). And Morse didn’t ignore his constituents’ opinions; he acknowledged them while also recognizing that what he did was, however controversial, justified and honorable, done to protect the same citizens who were speaking against him.
John Morse has a long record of making other people’s well-being a priority, choosing a life devoted to helping people. Whether putting his own personal safety on the line as police officer, then chief; as a senior paramedic saving lives; as the CEO of a benevolent, non-profit senior citizen services organization (“Biography”); or as an earnest senate president battling for the protection of his constituents, Morse’s actions were selfless. In the face of the recall, Senator Morse concluded courageously that, “We had to do gun control, and I said months ago, if passing gun safety bills cost me my political career, that’s an amazingly small price to pay. The families of these victims have to pay a huge price every single day for the rest of their lives” (qtd. in Lee).",0,2014
"Colorado State Senator Jane Doe may not have been the archetype of an elusive, politically savvy legislator on the issue of healthcare reform. As a former nurse who had firsthand experience with the healthcare system's shortcomings, she possessed a deeply personal stake in the matter. Her profound commitment to improving healthcare for her constituents led her to support a controversial bill to expand Medicaid coverage, despite knowing that it could alienate some of her staunchest supporters. Her unwavering stance on the bill was propelled by her conviction that it was the best course of action for the people she served, even though it did not align with the majority of her constituents' wishes.
Senator Doe was instrumental in pushing through substantial legislation aimed at broadening access to healthcare following a notable outbreak of a preventable disease. Faced with opposition from pro-market activists and healthcare conglomerates, Doe stood firm in her beliefs, understanding the divide in her politically mixed state. Echoing Kennedy's sentiment, she had no regrets about potentially sacrificing her political career, considering it an act of dedication to her unyielding principles.
Hailing from a state deeply affected by healthcare crises, Senator Doe likely felt a heightened sense of duty to enact significant reforms. One of the bills she championed imposed a cap on insurance premiums, mandated comprehensive coverage for preventative services, and barred insurance denial based on pre-existing conditions. Although these reforms were unpopular with a significant portion of her electorate, she was resolute. In a district that predominantly supported opposition candidates, Doe recognized that her political future was at risk but maintained that ensuring the health and safety of her constituents was more important than her career.
Despite widespread opposition to healthcare reform, particularly among fiscal conservatives and large insurance companies renowned for their political influence, Senator Doe faced a barrage of negative advertising and public condemnation. Still, she stood by her decision, asserting that the legislation would ultimately result in cost savings for taxpayers and provide better coverage for patients.
Senator Doe did not conform to the prevailing political winds but rather made use of the ""independent judgment"" that is vital to a healthy democracy, as Kennedy championed. When she faced recall, fewer than 15% of registered voters in her district cast their ballots, underscoring the challenges of mobilizing a silent majority that might have supported her reforms.
In discussions with the media, Senator Doe emphasized that while she took her constituents' views into account, she was also guided by a broader vision of the public good, as Kennedy described. She was committed to leading and informing her constituents, occasionally correcting and even disregarding popular opinion when necessary to uphold the principles of her office.
Senator Doe's career was marked by an enduring commitment to the welfare of others. From her days in the emergency room to her tenure as a non-profit executive advocating for patient rights, her actions consistently prioritized public service over personal gain. In reflecting on the recall efforts, she remained firm, stating that if championing healthcare reform cost her her seat, it was a small sacrifice compared to the benefits it would bring to the lives of her constituents.",1,2014
"Immigration reform is one of the most contentious issues in America today, provoking angry debates in Congress, fueling tension in town hall meetings across the country, and even dividing families. In 2007, as the battle over immigration reform played out in Congress, Tom Selders, the Republican mayor of Greeley, Colorado, put a local face on the issue. Selders spoke out on Capitol Hill about the devastating effect of an immigration raid at a Greeley meatpacking plant and urged Congress to enact comprehensive immigration reform. As a result, he faced a backlash of criticism at home. Selders knew his public stance on immigration was politically risky, particularly since he was seeking reelection in the upcoming mayoral race. Nonetheless, as an elected official, he felt an obligation to advocate for all the people of Greeley, especially those who otherwise would have no voice (Bernuth). Like the courageous senators in Profiles in Courage, Selders was willing to “sacrifice all—including his own career—for” his principles and the greater good (Kennedy 7).
A lifelong Republican from a conservative town, Selders may seem an unlikely advocate for immigration reform. He admits that while growing up on the affluent west side of Greeley, he rarely ventured into the working class Latino neighborhoods on the east side of town. As mayor, however, Selders was determined to meet with community groups from all parts of Greeley to ensure he was representing the interests of all residents, regardless of race, class, or nationality (Riccardi). In December 2006, Selders learned that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents had raided the Swift & Company meatpacking plant—Greeley’s largest employer—and arrested 262 undocumented workers as part of a multi-city enforcement action known as “Operation Wagon Train” (Perl 88). Eyewitnesses reported that those detained were “treated like animals” (Cooper). They were handcuffed and shackled, denied access to food, water, and bathrooms, and were not allowed to contact their families (“ICE”).
Shortly after the raid, many of those arrested were deported. Others remained in legal limbo for more than a year awaiting a hearing (Warner). On the day of the raid, more than 200 Greeley children returned home to find one or both parents gone (Lofholm). Selders sympathized with the children—many of whom were U.S. citizens—who were “devastated by their parents being arrested and detained,” but he initially did not speak out (Riccardi). When John F. Kennedy first entered Congress, he was told that “the way to get along is to go along” (Kennedy 4). These words were equally applicable to the situation in Greeley, where local leaders faced pressure to not “rock the boat” by taking positions contrary to the prevailing political sentiment (Thompson). However, as more details emerged about the raid and as community relations degenerated over the immigration issue, Selders knew he could not remain silent. He denounced the inhumane treatment of those arrested. “People with leg irons and handcuffs—was that really necessary?” he asked. “Is this what our country is about?” (qtd. in Olinger).
In May 2007, Selders traveled to Washington, D.C. to speak to Congressional lobbyists about the impact of the raid on immigrant families and the community (Delgado). He recognized his actions would likely be unpopular with those who had helped Greeley earn its reputation as “a GOP stronghold” (Cooper). Yet, he also knew that promoting the dignity and respect of all residents, especially those he “felt had not been well represented,” was the “right thing to do” (qtd. in Bernuth). Selders also hoped to prompt meaningful debate about immigration reform and move the discussion past divisive, partisan bickering and toward constructive solutions (Selders). In Profiles in Courage, Kennedy commended elected officials who had the political courage to break with their parties and place “their convictions ahead of their careers” (206). By taking a stand in favor of a more humane immigration policy, Selders did just that.
In the wake of his trip, Selders faced tremendous political repercussions. He was vilified on local talk radio (Riccardi), and received angry emails and “more hate calls than I care to mention” (qtd. in Quintero). Some accused him of wanting to turn Greeley into a sanctuary for illegal immigrants. Others called him “traitor scum” and derisively asked, “Have you thought about running for mayor of your favorite country, Mexico?” (“Swift Justice”). There were threats of a recall petition and demands that Selders withdraw his reelection bid (“Residents”). But Selders refused to be intimidated. “When you get elected to a job like mayor,” he said, “you deal with controversy” (qtd. in Villegas).
During Selders’ reelection campaign, his challenger blasted his stance on immigration and members of his own party actively campaigned against him (Boyle). Selders was also the target of hateful campaign mailings by anonymous groups. One accused him of advocating “instant U.S. citizenship” for undocumented workers (“Greeley”). Another claimed Selders was soft on “gangs, crimes and illegals” (Louis-Sanchez).
In the end, Selders’ refusal to “compromise away his principles” (Kennedy 11) on immigration cost him the election (“Greeley”). The Los Angeles Times called Selders’ defeat “a cautionary tale of the politics of illegal immigration,” which, to some, showed “how a good man trying to do the right thing was taken down by the forces of intolerance” (Riccardi). Following his defeat, Selders was asked if he would speak out again, knowing the political consequences. “I’d do it again in a heartbeat because it was the right thing to do and it needed to be done,” he replied. “[I]llegal people who are here are still human beings. They deserve at least the dignity of being treated with respect” (qtd. in Bernuth).
Today, America finds itself at a crossroads as it grapples with the question of what type of nation it aspires to be. Does it want to be a country that deprives individuals of their basic human rights simply because of their immigrant status? Tom Selders courageously said no. By taking a stand in favor of immigration reform and the basic dignity and humanity of all people, Selders did more than exemplify political courage: he showed what it means to be an American and uphold the values that we, as a nation of immigrants, should hold dear.",0,2015
"Amid the intense national debate on education reform, Mayor Linda Harris of Springfield, Illinois, took an audacious step. In 2010, as Congress grappled with the reauthorization of the No Child Left Behind Act, Harris used her platform to shed light on the critical state of Springfield’s public schools and the dire need for substantial change. With a career steeped in community activism and a passion for public service, Harris was acutely aware of the challenges facing the education system. Despite potential political fallout, she felt compelled to speak out for those in the shadows of the education debate — particularly the underprivileged and students with disabilities. Her stance was reminiscent of the spirit found in Profiles in Courage, willing to risk her political future for a cause she deemed just and necessary.
A Republican with a reputation for fiscal conservatism, Harris was perhaps an unexpected advocate for sweeping education reform, including increased funding for schools and support for teachers. She understood that her advocacy might conflict with the views of her constituents and the austerity measures supported by many in her party. Yet, Mayor Harris, inspired by the stories she encountered daily — from overcrowded classrooms to teachers spending out of pocket on supplies — knew that silence was not an option.
Harris’s journey into the heart of the education reform battle began with a visit to one of the most overcrowded schools in her district, where she saw the stark realities of the crumbling infrastructure and lack of resources. The visit galvanized her resolve to address these inequities, and she soon found herself testifying before a congressional committee, calling for urgent action to rectify the neglect of public education. Her calls for reform stirred a hornet’s nest back home, eliciting harsh criticism from some constituents who felt she was overstepping her bounds and threatening Springfield’s reputation for educational autonomy.
Despite mounting opposition, including a highly vocal minority calling for her resignation, Harris echoed Kennedy’s words, believing that elected officials must lead, educate, and sometimes defy public opinion to serve the greater good. She faced a barrage of negative media, was branded a “traitor” to conservative principles, and endured slanderous campaign tactics, yet she stood firm in her conviction that true leadership meant making tough choices for the benefit of all.
Mayor Harris’s re-election bid became a referendum on her education advocacy. Opponents framed her as a mayor who had betrayed her party’s principles and lost touch with her community’s values. The election results were a mirror of the divided sentiment in Springfield — Mayor Harris lost, a casualty of the very battle she waged to transform the city’s schools.
Reflecting on her defeat, Harris maintained she had no regrets. To her, the battle for educational equity was more than a political issue; it was a moral imperative. “I would take the same stand again,” she said, “because our children’s future is worth any sacrifice. Education is not just a political talking point; it’s the bedrock of our society, and every child deserves a fair chance.”
Harris’s story serves as a modern-day parable, challenging us to consider the values and priorities we want our leaders to uphold. It also underscores the courage required to confront entrenched systems, push for meaningful change, and champion the rights of those often left voiceless. In the end, Linda Harris did more than just participate in the political process; she elevated the discourse on education and, in doing so, embodied the ideals of democracy.",1,2015
